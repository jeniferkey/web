I had to</font>

earlier in</font>

walk and</font>

of the rain, but</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we did end up in the grass on the side
because she was sensitive</font>

and getting settled. I also clipped her earlier this week (not her feet)
and she was great for that. I've been working with the trailer loading
all week, and today we walked over, I pointed her and clucked, and she
climbed right in. Backed her out and did it again. She definitely learns
and I think my training style will work with her.</font></center>

<center>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some panicky moments before
we started off, but then we got in sync. After mounting I pulled on a rein
to turn her and she pivoted and then went sideways when I asked her to
halt. I think the bit doesn't sit right with her mouth (teeth or something).
I'm going to try a different one and also have the vet out for a float.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Oh, and also a comment on me after that
point. I asked Bart to come hold her, which he did, and then I asked him
to lead her just a bit. He said that he didn't feel comfortable, and if
she did the same thing he'd let go and get away from her. Well, that sounded
worse than just going it on my own, so I asked her to walk on again. From
there on I didn't feel afraid. I rode in a secure seat, but I didn't have
to get off. It's pretty nice to have my nerve back and feel like I can
handle a green horse.</font></center>

driveway to go up and down. I almost feel safer on it than in the open
arena in the pasture. Most horses aren't that keen to go fast on the gravel,
so I feel a bit more in control. This girl kept trying to get in the grass,
which would put me under the trees, so I had to work at keeping her straight.</font></center>

She knows to move her hind legs away from leg pressure. It made her a little
