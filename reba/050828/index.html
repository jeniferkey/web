first dressage show.</font>

nervous about all&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the trailers and other horses, but I felt
quite secure when I was on her.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I figured if she ever did decide to bolt,
I was safe up there and we'd just</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">go through anything we came to.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Her scores were very nice. Both were over
60% and we got a 4th and 2nd.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She goes where I ask, but the corners
can be a little questionable.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A lot like driving a boat. She never neighed
under saddle, but did call</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to Angel when I'd leave her back at the
trailer and take Angel to show.</font></center>

right (and adjusted my leathers for me). Hmm, that was when I was on Angel,
