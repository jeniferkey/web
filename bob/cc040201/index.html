Sky Vista</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We ended up going alone with our trainer.
Bob looked</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at everything, but didn't seem upset to
be alone. He never</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">neighed at the other horses. There was
a dog in a kennel near</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">one of the jumps. He startled Bob once,
and then when we came back</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">around to take the fence again, the dog
leapt up and jumped at the fence</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and barked. That was too much for Bob
out on his own. We had a minor</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">bolt through the trees. I circled him,
and we took the fence again.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This time out was nothing like last weekend.
I have nerve issues, and last</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">weekend out schooling cross country I
think I made it over three jumps.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We'd made it around the GAG stadium course
clear, but I let someone else</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">get on him for the cantering and jumping
cross country.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Luckily today I had my nerve back, and
even with all our green issues, I had fun.</font></center>
