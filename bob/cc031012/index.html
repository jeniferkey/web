Country School</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>at Quail Run</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We had a great day. The
event we planned to go to was cancelled due to rain, so</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>we quickly changed our plans
and just went out to school at a different farm.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I was nervous for our first
time out, but Bob was wonderful. Our first warm up fence was an X,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and Bob made it obvious
that he wasn't sure why we were there. We trotted up to it, and he stopped
and</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>walked over it. A few more
times around and we were cantering away and ready for the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>vertical and oxer. The only
stop we had out on the course was a drop jump that had a ditch</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>in it. We trotted up to
it happily, and right at the take-off he spotted the ditch and had to take
a look.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The next two times he hesitated
a little, but jumped to the other side.</font></font>
