<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Lydia rode Bob in Intro 2. She hadn't
ridden him in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">quite a while, so I was a little concerned
about having</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">her ask for a canter. They warmed up and
got to know each</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">other. I don't think they they ever connected
on how to really stop, and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">unfortunately Lydia found the canter button
in the middle of their</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">walk/trot test. Still, they got a third
in the class and I got to see what</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I need to work on for training horses
that other people will ride.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For better or worse, it seems like I train
them to want fewer pounds in the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">rein, and longer reins to show more length
of neck. It feels to me, and I guess</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">my horses, like I don't really use the
reins for much. Just a feel of the mouth,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but legs and body for stopping and turning
and slowing down and speeding up.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some rein to soften in a bend and even
a little more right now as we work on</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">lateral stuff. Now that Bob is fairly
rhythmic and steady, I really don't use the reins</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for speed that much. I guess as we start
to work more on engagement I'll start</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to feel more in the reins. But, I'll be
putting more leg on first and see where we need</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to go from there...</font>
