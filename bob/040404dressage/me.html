<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's been a while since our last dressage
show, but he's</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">been doing so good it seemed we should
continue our move</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">up Training Level from 1 &amp; 2 to 3
&amp; 4. I was very nervous about</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">taking him to this particular venue. He
had hated the judges stand</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">last time, and been a bit 'naughty' as
the judge had put it.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This time we were there early for Herbie,
so I took him in the ring before</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">they started and let him sniff the judges
stand and look at the scary tarp</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">just outside the ring. He was great. The
judge was looking at the wrong test,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and we had to start over, which worked
in our favor.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, for Training 3 we got 61.67% and 2nd
place and Training 4 we got 59.23%</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and 4th place. On the second test the
judge wanted more impulsion and engagement</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(don't they always), but I know he's got
it. Her bottom comment was 'Great rhythm and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">obedience, work toward engagement for
future brilliance'. I had to go tell Bob that</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the judge thought he had brilliance in
his future...</font>
