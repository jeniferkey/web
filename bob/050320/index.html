shows, so</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it seemed like a good idea to throw on
the dressage saddle and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">get a lesson. He was out hunting last
weekend, but I left him at home</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">this past Saturday (4 hours out, and tons
of running).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had some awesome work today and I think
in a couple of</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">weeks we'll be ready for our First Level
debut.</font></center>
