Bob. I pulled</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">something in my groin and I've tried to
stay off him for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a few months. He seemed a bit jealous
of the other guys,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but I was sure to stop and say hi a few
times a day.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He's quite wide, and has such movement,
that I would</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ache for days after I tried riding. So,
after a few months off,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we're back to trying to get in shape.</font></center>

just trotting up and down the hills for a few weeks will help him build
back up just about as much as the dressage work. He won't have to think
so much, and we can go back to the dressage stuff once he's in a little
better shape. At least he showed me that he hasn't forgotten the canter
we'd learned this past spring, and I'm sure he'll find it more fun when
it doesn't wear us out so quickly (100 degree temperatures during the day
doesn't help...).</font></center>
