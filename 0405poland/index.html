really close to Konin (which has a train station), so we took a train from
Middelfart to Copenhagen, a bus from Copenhagen to Malmo, Sweden, then
a night train from Malmo to Berlin and another train from Berlin to Konin.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The night train was great. A private room
with a litle bathroom. We just locked the door and slept all the way to
Berlin.</font></center>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well, most things didn't go as planned.
We arrived at the train station, but didn't find anyone waiting for us.
After getting Polish money and wandering around the train and bus stations
for a while (boy did Bart like that), I decided to get him to a hotel and
find out about my relatives.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I asked a taxi driver (who didn't speak
English) to take us to a good, but not too good hotel. We drove forever,
Bart getting very nervous that it was a set up, and we ended up at this
hotel. Way out in the country, no where near even a store, but what could
we do?</font></center>

<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The View out our Hotel Window</font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Actually a very nice hotel by Polish standards
(and expensive by their standards, but only $40 US).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I left Bart at the hotel to relax and
took the taxi to KB to find my relatives. What I found out was that they
were still at the train station and had been waiting now for 4 hours. Once
they came home and it was all sorted out, it seems that they were waiting
for the train to come from Warsaw, and we were on the train from Berlin...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, we'd already gotten the hotel and
learned that we must never get a hotel or taxi in Poland again. Zdzislawa
made it clear (in Polish) that we were family and there was always a place
for us at their home.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was horrified that they sat at the train
station for so long, but at least Bart was at the hotel taking pictures
and walking around and not walking with us toward Konin to see if we saw
them coming back in the car....</font></center>

food on the table. We ate and ate in Poland. My favorite dish was the schnitzel
we had for lunch the second day. The pork is pounded very thin and then
breaded and fried. Served with cabbage and potatoes and other stuff I can't
remember. When we'd start to stop eating, someone would say why don't you
like it, there's still some left...</font></center>
