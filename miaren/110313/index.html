    We had a great dressage warm up and were in sync for the test.<br />
       The stadium warm up was a bit stressful, but the stadium round was a lot of fun.
    <br />Cross country would have gone better if I'd have let him go, 
    <br />
    but we made it around close to time and no refusals or run outs.<br />
    Our final score was 37.4 (33 for dressage and 4.4 sec over time). 
    <br />
    We stayed in 2nd place after each phase.<br /> I thought he'd not want to go out on cross country after doing the two other parts, 
    <br />
    but not to worry. He went.

      Less warm up than usual, but he was off his forehand from the start and not rushy,
      just swingy and forward. We'd schooled the cross country course the day before, so
      that might have been in his mind.<br />

      I like what his inside hind is doing in the turn, but not what my inside leg is
      doing. I should be dropping in the heel and making that leg longer. Not sure what
      I was thinking.<br />

      They always want more forward or energy. He was as forward as I've felt him in a
      test. Forward without jigging is difficult for me.<br />

</div><div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">

    Looking at these, he could have had an inch or so more rein. I wish my rein stops were
    just where I needed them.</div>

      When we picked
        up our trot to come in the ring his hind feet started stepping up
      high towards his belly. I think he was feeling the dirt hit his belly and was 
      a bit irritated.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="0018.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        We were dinged on our canter transitions. The judge said I was shortening him at
        the trot so he didn't have the impulsion he needed and he had to jump into it.
        That transition is still something I'm worried won't happen. We'll figure it out.
        We've had the canter I want once at home now, so I know it's in there.</div>

      Just happy to have kept the canter after the leap.<br />

<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="0020.jpg"  alt="" /><br />
        He's giving to the bit at the canter more frequently. I think that means we'll be
        able to start working on the quality and balance. It shows that I don't think during
        a test, seeing that I go from this posture to the next picture only after the canter
        circle.</div>


  <div class="right">

  <div class="right">
      <img src="0021.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        If I lift my shoulders and open my chest we can look pretty nice. I only thought
      about it as we were coming to the downward transition, because I've learned that
      it helps.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        I was so happy with our ride. It wasn't a lot of work for me and he was trying so
        hard to do what he thought I wanted in the ring.</div>

      I really liked our halt, but the judge thought we weren't straight. I think our
      success in dressage is partly due to the jumping and him learning forward while
      having more fun.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="0025.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        I have to trust him more. The entire jumping day was spent with me not
        giving him his head over the jumps. I still can't make myself believe that if I
        give him his head he won't take off (when it seems very likely that my not giving
        him his head causes him to try and take off).<br />

      Our last time riding an outside course we were eliminated because of stops at a fence.
      I had a plan to ride more aggressively to the questionable fences here.<br />

<div class ="container">

        We started from a trot and he was a little surprised when we got to the first fence.<br />

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        I let him take a long spot to the third one, and he was in his jumping mode.<br />

        I'm not one to count strides. I did walk the course before we rode, but the only
        things I focused on were my approach to one and the skinny at the end.<br />

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        I wondered if he'd look at this one. He didn't.<br />

  <div class="right">

      I wasn't thinking about my position at all. I was thinking that if I looked toward
      the next fence he'd get the correct lead. It worked, but a longer release would
      have been nicer for him.<br />

</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        Again, handsy, trying to get him to balance before the next fence.<br />

      Unfortunately I think he felt he needed to take a flyer because of my 'balancing',
      which meant I got left behind. Luckily he didn't hold it against me and I slipped
      enough rein to keep him going to the next jump in the combination.<br />

        After the bank I wanted to trot down the slope. He said fine, but it was going to
        be his flying trot. Unfortunately I haven't figured out how to do a canter transition
        from a lengthen, so we did the long stretch to the next jump in a lengthen.<br />

        More trotting when we encountered another rider. I could just see him dropping a
        shoulder and following that horse instead of finishing our course (I don't think
        the thought ever entered his mind).<br />

      I think it was a gallop. Well, maybe a hand gallop. All four feet were off the ground
      at one time. I've never let him out and during a show didn't seem to be the time
      to see what would happen.<br />

    We canter stadium fences, but we haven't worked out how it should feel to jump cross
    country jumps from a forward canter. He saw no reason to slow up, and I didn't want
    to mess with him too much before the jump. There was some compromise.</div>

      But, I let him pick his spot (very long) because going that speed, chipping in wouldn't
      have felt all that good. I did slip the reins and made sure not to pull on landing.
      No head tossing and we cantered on to find the finish flags.<br />
