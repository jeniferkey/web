        Novice Horse Trial on Miaren<br />
      </span>Greenwood Farm<br />
      We had a lot of nerves to deal with here. Miaren found everything
      interesting and exciting<br />
      and I was stressed to be on an enthusiastic Miaren. We were 1st after
      dressage with a <span class="fbPhotoCaptionText">33.2</span><br />
        and stayed there even with a rail down in stadium. We were a bundle of
      nerves<br />
      in the XC warm up, but <span class="fbPhotoCaptionText">but after a while
        when he'd squeal in his transitions we'd just laugh and shake our heads.
        <br />
        He was having fun. </span>Once we were on course he was happy and
      looking for the <br />
      next fence. Half way through I was tired, but I could relax and trust him.<br />
      Our first recognized event was a success.<br />

            our best dressage test. It's been a while since he's leapt into his
            transitions. At one point in the trot he jumped to the side for fun.
            He was also irritated by the braids and kept throwing his head
            around in the warm up. He's an opinionated one. Luckily we've done a
            lot of dressage work and he held it together even though he really
            wanted to be running and jumping.</span></span></div>
