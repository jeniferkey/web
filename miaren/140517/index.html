        Show on Miaren<br />      </span>We entered the 3' division and had a lot of fun.<br />      I was a little nervous because the jumps looked bigger, but after the<br />      first fence Miaren made it clear that height was not a concern.<br />      We came away with a variety of ribbons and Reserve Champ for the division.<br />      I was most pleased that in the derby he didn't even look at the ditch and      sailed over.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        A fun day. The show photographer got some lovely pictures.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /> <br />        Jumping the fences they didn't feel big, but looking at them they sure        looked it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        We had a couple of bad spots. This was the first one, but I held on and        didn't interfere and he got us over without hitting it.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /> <br />        Landing and turning.

He'd tend to get going too fast and        get too close to the last fence, but he was still careful each time.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06.jpg" /> <br />        Watching for the lead when I should be looking for the next jump.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="07.jpg" /> <br />        When I did it correctly he got the lead and we ended up with good spots.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08.jpg" /> <br />        On the derby course. We had one refusal out here, but we weren't the        only one at that particular fence. It was straight forward, but I guess        not to the horses.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="09.jpg" /> <br />        Fun with filters.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10.jpg" /> <br />        A shot after he went over the ditch.
