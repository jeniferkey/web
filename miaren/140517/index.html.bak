        Show on Miaren<br />
      </span>We entered the 3' division and had a lot of fun.<br />
      I was a little nervous because the jumps looked bigger, but after the<br />
      first fence Miaren made it clear that height was not a concern.<br />
      We came away with a variety of ribbons and Reserve Champ for the division.<br />
      I was most pleased that in the derby he didn't even look at the ditch and
      sailed over.<br />

        A fun day. The show photographer got some lovely pictures.</div>
    </div>

        Jumping the fences they didn't feel big, but looking at them they sure
        looked it.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>

    <div class="container">

        We had a couple of bad spots. This was the first one, but I held on and
        didn't interfere and he got us over without hitting it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="04.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        Landing and turning. I got a bit sloppy, but Miaren was in the game and
        didn't hold it against me.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>

        The in and out always made me grin. He'd tend to get going too fast and
        get too close to the last fence, but he was still careful each time.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="06.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        Watching for the lead when I should be looking for the next jump.</div>

      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="07.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        When I did it correctly he got the lead and we ended up with good spots.</div>

        On the derby course. We had one refusal out here, but we weren't the
        only one at that particular fence. It was straight forward, but I guess
        not to the horses.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="09.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        First fence on course. I'm riding better if our spot is good.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="10.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        We'd done a jumper show the weekend before that made this course feel
        fun and easy.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">

        Telling him which lead to land on just by looking.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="12.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        This is what I'd like to fix. If he gets a short spot I still stand up
        and get out of his way. I don't really bother him, but it's not the most
        secure way to ride a fence.</div>

        I was so pleased that for all the jumping I was able to stay back and
        wait for him to jump. Not driving him to the fences, <br />
        but not jumping ahead and interfering like I did when I was nervous at
        Greenwood.</div>
