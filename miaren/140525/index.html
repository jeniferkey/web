        Novice Horse Trial on Miaren<br />      </span>It was surprising that we had so much rain in Abilene, but Miaren      was<br />      up to the challenge. We were in 3rd after dressage and moved up to<br />      2nd in stadium and stayed there after 6 seconds time faults on XC.<br />      Everything was damp and the truck and trailer had to be pulled out of the      mud,<br />      but we were both relaxed and enjoyed ourselves.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        He looks a little worried here. Maybe he'd also seen the Accuweather app        that said a giant storm was closing in on us.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /> <br />        We got a 31 on our dressage. Better than Greenwood because we were        relaxed, but I'm hoping to get back down<br />        in the 20s.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        The footing was pretty good considering the rain. I did put studs in to        help in the corners.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /> <br />        We went with a French braid this time. He didn't have as much head        shaking, and it stayed in just fine.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="05.jpg" /> <br />        Our canter is coming along. What really dinged us was when a bug flew in        his face as we turned for our walk across the diagonal.<br />        I could feel that if I let out rein he was going to start shaking his        head and maybe trot or paw. So, I had to keep him shorter than<br />        usual for all of the walk to keep him focused on something other than        the bug up his nose.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06.jpg" /> <br />        For the last part of the test he was obedient, but used his ears to say        he was being bothered.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="07.jpg" /> <br />        A nice halt and a nose rub when he got out to deal with that stupid bug.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08.jpg" /> <br />        We wore our XC gear for stadium. As soon as we were finished in there        they moved us to the start box. I think only<br />        3 or so riders on Sunday had to ride in the rain. They did a great job        getting done early to beat the weather that day.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="09.jpg" /> <br />        First fence on course. I'm riding better if our spot is good.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10.jpg" /> <br />        We'd done a jumper show the weekend before that made this course feel        fun and easy.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="11.jpg" /> <br />        Telling him which lead to land on just by looking.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="12.jpg" /> <br />        This is what I'd like to fix. If he gets a short spot I still stand up        and get out of his way. I don't really bother him, but it's not the most        secure way to ride a fence.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="13.jpg" /> <br />        I was so pleased that for all the jumping I was able to stay back and        wait for him to jump. Not driving him to the fences, <br />        but not jumping ahead and interfering like I did when I was nervous at        Greenwood.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="14.jpg" /><br />        I don't really need the bit for stadium, but I do for XC and we've both        gotten comfortable with it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="15.jpg" /> <br />        The lizard standards were brightly painted on the other side. I was        worried Miaren might take a peek, but he was all business.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="16.jpg" /> <br />        Getting excited that we might make it around without him touching a        fence.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="17.jpg" /> <br />        Letting him take a leap and a long spot knowing he didn't plan on        hitting anything today.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="18.jpg" /> <br />        He looked at all the XC fences that he hadn't seen before, but I waited        to jump with him at each fence and I never felt hesitation once we were        committed to the jump.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="19.jpg" /> <br />        I like seeing his hind end under him as we approach the fence.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="20.jpg" /> <br />        Another short spot and me thinking standing up is the best way to help        him over. I didn't jump ahead, which is much more risky, but I think        this is a habit I learned from<br />        being too close to the saddle and getting popped out with the short        spot. Some day I'll figure it out and stop riding him as if he were one        of my other horses. But, at<br />        least I'm consistent.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="21.jpg" /> <br />        He was very suspicious of the bright blue water. It's been a while since        he's not wanted to gallop and plung through.</div>    </div>  </body></html>
