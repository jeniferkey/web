        Novice Horse Trial on Miaren<br />      </span>It was surprising that we had so much rain in Abilene, but Miaren      was<br />      up to the challenge. We were in 3rd after dressage and moved up to<br />      2nd in stadium and stayed there after 6 seconds time faults on XC.<br />      Everything was damp and the truck and trailer had to be pulled out of the      mud,<br />      but we were both relaxed and enjoyed ourselves.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        He was a little sticky to the first fence and I jumped ahead. After that        we were good.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /> <br />        A nice easy line. But, I was concentrating so hard on getting the        correct lead for the roll back that I never checked to see if he was        already on the correct lead. There was just a bit of ribbing for doing a        simple change back to the same lead. But hey, we had the correct lead.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        I'm always working on my position. Pretty good with the hips here, but        my back is rarely flat enough.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /> <br />        Giving him rein to reach, but I'd like to get the habit of doing that        while keeping my hips back and my back flat.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="05.jpg" /> <br />        For a while this fence (in a different spot on course) is what kept me        from schooling or showing novice. It seemed so big that I didn't think        I'd ever have the confidence to let him have the engagement needed to        get over it.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06.jpg" /> <br />        He only started pulling as we got up to this one. I think with the first        fence he's never sure if it's going to be a course or just jump and stop        like schooling.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="07.jpg" /> <br />        Grinning because we were in agreement on speed.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08.jpg" /> <br />        That cobby stretch.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="09.jpg" /> <br />        Around the back side I let him pick up speed, but he always balanced for        his fences. Not the speed we've hit out fox hunting that makes me feel        panicked, but it still had me wondering if he'd listen when I asked him        to slow up.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10.jpg" /> <br />        We turned to the up bank and he asked to trot a couple of strides        before. I was surprised, but let him. The day before I'd not given        enough up the bank and he might have remembered that.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="11.jpg" /> <br />        This combination worred me a bit since it was after the bank and a        downhill slope, but he climbed over it easily.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="12.jpg" /> <br />        He hesitated a little here, but last year we were eliminated at this        ditch, so quite an improvement.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="13.jpg" /> <br />        I thought we'd get 3 strides here, but no, he decided on 2.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="14.jpg" /><br />        Not my ideal position, but we got the job done.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="15.jpg" /> <br />        Heading for home. Both a bit tired, but still excited.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="16.jpg" /> <br />        I'm not sure why my position was so bad here, but he took care of me.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="17.jpg" /> <br />        Big bench deserves a big jump.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="18.jpg" /> <br />        I'm not sure why my position was so bad here, but he took care of me.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="19.jpg" /> <br />        Big bench deserves a big jump.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="20.jpg" /> <br />        I'm not sure why my position was so bad here, but he took care of me.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="21.jpg" /> <br />        Big bench deserves a big jump.</div>    </div>  </body></html>
