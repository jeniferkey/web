pictures the day of the show, so</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>we didn't get a lot of good
pictures schooling. Unfortunately</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>the show was cancelled due
to rain, so this is what we have.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He was brilliant schooling
for Laura, and looked eager and happy the entire</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>time. Well, except for when
he was learning that he had to go when told,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>even if there was a drop
or ditch involved. He didn't hold a grudge, and once he</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>figured out his rider wouldn't
give in, he seemed very proud to do the ditch</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and bank in the end.</font></font></center>
