<span style="font-size:2em; font-weight:bold">Combined Test at Willow Draw<br />
</span><br />
    It was a very blustery day. We were alone in the dressage warm up on the hill.<br />
    Most riders warmed up around the dressage ring, which made it a bit distracting<br />
    trying to enter at A.<br />
    Our dressage has been going gangbusters lately with a new dressage saddle.<br />
    Of course it's all a bit different in a test. I was clutchy and it took part of
    the test<br />
    for me to relax and let him relax. Part way through he started reaching into the
    bridle and<br />
    rounding up nicely. His trot work got very light and lovely. Our canter is always
    improving<br />
    and I was very pleased with our right lead. I thought the scoring was a bit tough
    (but fair)<br />
    and I believed the judge when she gave us a 7 on our walk. He's not been free across
    the school,<br />
    but with the new saddle he seems to enjoy stretching out and moving.<br /> We were 5th after dressage (8 horses I think). Our jumping warm up was enthusiastic.<br />
    In stadium we pulled the
    first rail. We were so happy to be in a comfortable canter
    that I forgot to
    <br />
    balance him until we were at the jump. He got in a little close and pulled it.<br />
       The rest of the course we were clean. We got more leads than in the past, but still
    need to work on<br />
    landing on the lead I'd like. One roll back we had to come back to a trot as we
    were getting tired,<br />
    but tooling around a course on him is fun.<br />
    There were others with refusals and we ended up in 5th place.<br />

            It was nasty windy up there, and typically it's a part of the cross country course.

    Heading toward our downward walk transition. He was so good. Usually we almost stop
    and then walk on slowly. He did a smooth downward right into the walk. It could
    have had a little more energy, but I think I was a little tense wondering if he'd
    listen to my request and forgetting to relax myself once we had it.</div>

    Not a good canter transition to the left (and I forgot to stay on the circle for
    a stride or two). I've been working to have smooth transitions where he stays round
    without my holding him (holding then he braces). We've had a few at home and one
    in the warm up. At least there wasn't a buck into the transition and it happens
    when asked.</div>

      Downward not as balanced as we can be, but he goes soft and round almost immediately
      now.</div>

      I'm supposed to use my tummy muscles to stay upright and influence him at the canter
      with my seat and back more than my legs. I might be doing that here.</div>

        Turn up the center line. We've been working on leg yielding off the center line
        so we can get a bit wiggly heading toward the judge as he tries to figure out which
        leg to move off of.</div>

      I suspect this was set at training height looking at the tape marks. It looked a
      little big to me but with Miaren there's no worry he's not going to try.</div>

        Third jump on course. I think my stirrups were a little long. Amanda was in the
        saddle the day before for hunting and we did a lot of adjusting.</div>

        The roll back to six we just couldn't stay in a canter. I let him get a little strung
        out, but he was fine. I didn't walk the course or I'd have noticed the roll top
        part was out front, making the jump a fairly wide oxer. I wondered at the number
        of stops I saw at this jump. That fan in the background wasn't on our course. Can't
        wait til we're jumping the course where it is.</div>

      I got a little ahead on this jump. I tend to do that when I get tired. At least
      I'm looking toward our next jump.</div>

        An in and out at the end. My trainer told me to let him choose his stride. We weren't
        booking, but he was having fun and we did rub the last jump with him getting just
        a little too close to it. We'd watched a few horses take it down, so I wondered
        if it was a little tight between the two. Most likely they were like me and let
        their horses pick up some speed around the corner and they were too forward coming
        into it.<br />
        I love how much fun he looks like he's having. If he ever starts refusing we'll
        know something's not right.</div>
