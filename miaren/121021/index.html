</span><br />
    Our dressage went great. We had energy and were relaxed. He could have been softer<br />
    to the bridle, but he knew jumping was coming up. Our score was a 31.<br />
    Stadium was a lot of fun. We were together on all our spots, I gave over fences
    and he<br />
    appreciated it and didn't do any head shaking. We may have looked a bit fast, but
    I let him pick his<br />
    pace and it never felt out of control. We were first after dressage and stadium.&nbsp;<br />
    Cross country was a big question. We hadn't schooled the day before and we've had
    a lot of trouble<br />
    with ditches and banks in the past. I think that's all in the past. He cantered
    over the ditch and banks<br />
    and didn't seem to even consider them. We ended up with two refusals at separate jumps.
    One was in shadows<br />
    and he wanted to see it better, the other he wanted no part of, but reconsidered
    and took it for me from a trot.&nbsp;<br />We didn't make time with the refusals, but we're getting closer. We cantered most
    of the course and did a bit of<br />
    galloping. I don't think the move up in height really concerned him, but he's not
    yet comfortable jumping a jump he's
    <br />
    not been shown. We got past the ditches, I think we can work through this. With
    all that we took home a 3rd place ribbon.&nbsp;<br />

    Pretty much where I want myself and him giving the extra effort. We've finally got
    my stirrups shortened and it's helping my leg stay steady.</div>

      Leaping over the first jump on course. I tried to stay light and let him set the
      pace.</div>

    Forward to the fences gave us great spots for take off. I told him each time I wanted
    him to take off and he always agreed.</div>

      Reverting back in form because I got distracted with the simple lead change before
      the fence. I wasn't looking for the fence and we had to do a little swerve to get
      to it. He still put in a good effort without so much help from me.</div>
</div><div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">

    The first jump of the in and out. We didn't knock anything down, but his hind legs
    look close to this one. I could have a flatter back, but otherwise I'm just letting
    him do his thing.</div>

      I didn't sit in the saddle and drive him to the fences because he was pulling me
      to them. I kept my leg on for support and here I'm letting him set his stride for
      the second part of the in and out. He's good in grid work and it shows in combinations.</div>
</div>
<div class ="container">

        Me not being so effortless. When it works, that's how it feel over the fences.</div>

      This feels easy to me, but since it was a combination we didn't worry about striding
      so much. I think I still work too hard when it's a single jump and I want to get
      the right spot.</div>

        Waiting to go on course. Miaren wasn't completely relaxed, but we just wandered
        around until it was our time. I was curious to see how our ride would go. Lovely
        to start out with no nerves trying to control things.</div>

      Maybe shouldn't stick my toungue out when we're galloping. I think I was thinking,
      why'd he pick up the wrong lead to start.</div>

<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">

        He makes the bigger jumps look small to me. Nice and relaxed and not clutching.</div>

      The worst he got with his head. I wasn't pulling and put my leg on and he didn't
      need to toss his head because he could trust I wouldn't be in his face over the
      fences.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">

        I like how on his hind end he is a stride before the fence.</div>

      Me jumping for him a bit, but he's planting those hind feet and pushing us over.</div>

        Cantering down the bank. A first for us. He felt good and we were already looking
        for the jump around the tree.</div>

      But after the last refusal I wanted some control and when he trotted instead of
      collecting his canter I didn't mind.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">

        Hay bales to the ditch. I think the ditch was 4 or 5 strides out. It rode perfectly.</div>

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        I think we had a more balanced halt when he refused to go near the jump than our
        halt in the dressage ring.</div>

      We did a trot circle and then approached it. He wasn't pulling for
      it, but with
      leg on and a tap he was going.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">

        Hands a bit too high as I'm willing him over the jump.
        For a while we had a stop
        at every ditch, usually a refusal and re-present and
        sometimes a bit of time to
        waffle, look and then go over. Banks were similar. We got over that, so I think
        he can learn to trust that if I face him at it he can jump it. It'll just take more
        jumping of strange fences.</div>

      Cantering down the hill to the drop into the water. I hate cantering down the slope
      of our arena, but on cross country he feels good and balanced.</div>

        OK. No water, but a definite bank and a happy
      horse cantering down.</div>

        Still using his hind end and me not feeling so tired. Without the nerves beforehand
        I can last much longer on course. Who'd have thunk?</div>

      Aim for the pumpkin. Dead center. Maybe a little close, but he got himself out of
      the way and didn't touch it.</div>
