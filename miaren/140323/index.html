</span><br />
    I was going back and forth on entering Beginner Novice or Novice<br />
    this weekend (this farm tends to have good move up courses). I sent in my BN entry, but saw the week before that the jump<br />
    on the hill was included in BN and Novice (I miss remembered, and it ended up not
    being on BN), and noticed that we'd 
    <br />
    probably jumped
    most of the jumps on the novice course so I moved us up.<br />
    We'd fox hunted the day before, which doesn't lend itself to the best dressage<br />
    the next day, and we scored a 31.3, which isn't as good as I'd have liked.<br />
    I'd been a bit nervous on the drive over thinking of jumping and feeling a bit tired,<br />
    but once I was in the jumping saddle I was ready to jump.<br />
    Miaren was listening on course like our last event and I could slow him to switch leads when
    needed and<br />
    he'd balance before the fences when I asked. Also, he'd power up and engage for the jumps and combinations which made<br />
    the whole thing go rather well. It was nice to finish clean and come in first.<br /><br />

      The judge said he was nicely active, but needed more balance. He had energy, but
      didn't want to come through for me.</div>

      I didn't walk the course when it was set to Novice height, and all my focus was
      on how we'd do cross country, so I didn't pay much attention to the stadium jumps
      as we went around.</div>

      Happy through the water, but I'm starting to focus him because there was a little
      bank up and down that he would have no trouble with, but that we'd never thought to navigate.</div>

      Jump on the top of a hill. There was a bench on the back side, then the climb with
      this house on top and down to another jump at the bottom. It was nice to ride all
      the technical elements this course had. Training level had the same elements, but
      it's jump at the bottom was a bit narrower and taller. I know I've ridden other
      courses that shared things with Training level, but usually it's not fun technical
      stuff.</div>

        And I'm grinning because he carried us through like we jump on hilltops every day.</div>

      My trainer walked this combination, but never did like the striding. I wasn't concerned,
      and rightly.</div>

        Miaren hit his striding just right with the bending line.</div>
