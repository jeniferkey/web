        Novice Horse Trial on Miaren<br />
        <br />
      </span>I felt it was a win for us that I even put Miaren on the trailer
      and headed to the event.<br />
      Our dressage was average, but I was so proud that we held it together
      through the warm up and<br />
      there were parts of our test that I was so happy with. We've done better,
      but not with that much excitement going on.<br />
      Our XC warm up was crazy and I had to keep my mouth shut so I wouldn't
      just scratch right there. Once on the course<br />
      we had quite a bit of fun and everything went well until the ditch with
      gravel in it. I did nurse him over after<br />
      a few stops, so we were out of the running, but we weren't eliminated and
      had one more day to play.<br />
      For stadium a friend's trainer stepped in for Meg, who was on her way on a
      cruise, and we tooled around the<br />
      intimidating course nicely. One rail, off a corner and the wrong lead, but
      we'd finished, which was the goal when we started.<br />

        Clean and braided.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02md.jpg" />Some
        times he'd stretch down into the bridle, but there was also a bit of
        looking around.</div>

        We'd definitely peaked earlier in the season, but he was happy to be
        here and obedient.</div>

    <div class="container">

        Balancing on the turn.</div>

        And another turn coming up.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06md.jpg" /> <br />
        Across the diagonal. Not soft to the bit, but engaged.</div>

        I think we will always be working to get him to sit in his canter. I was
        happy with what he gave me, but the judge wanted better.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08md.jpg" /> <br />
        Happy with his halt.</div>

        First intimidating jump on course. Miaren was feeling great and just
        wanted to run.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10md.jpg" /> <br />
        Not thinking so much about my jumping position on course, as I was
        worried about the jump coming up.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="12md.jpg" /> <br />
        A bit more upright telling him where the next jump was and taking a
        feel.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="14md.jpg" /> <br />
        I could tell he knew where we were going, so letting him gallop a bit on
        the way.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="15md.jpg" /> <br />
        The jump after the (nasty) little ditch. I wasn't sure if we were going
        to be eliminated, but once they let us jump here we kept going.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="16md.jpg" /> <br />
        That parallel oxer looked big when we were walking the course. Miaren
        took it just right.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="17md.jpg" /> <br />
        Being sure I wasn't pulling too much and thinking ahead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="18md.jpg" /> <br />
        On the way to the drop.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="19md.jpg" /> <br />
        He decided to walk down and I was giving him as much rein as possible to
        let him look. Then there's all the gathering back up.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="20md.jpg" /> <br />
        Not the fast trot please. We'd really rather be in canter for the jumps.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="21md.jpg" /> <br />
        Yeah, canter.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="22md.jpg" /> <br />
        All muscled up and fit from a year of work.</div>

      <div class="left"> </div>

        Looking sleepy over the fence. He wasn't really tired, though.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="25md.jpg" /> <br />
        Last fence as eager as the first.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="26md.jpg" />Grabbing mane so I don't
        have to worry about interferring. And that's what a tired Jennifer looks
        like.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="29md.jpg" /> <br />
        Such a cool horse.</div>

      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="30md.jpg" /> <br />
        Pleased with himself heading back to the barns.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="31md.jpg" /> <br />
        First jump on course. A bit nervous on my side, but we settled after
        this fence.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="33md.jpg" /> <br />
        We were great with our spots this go round.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="34md.jpg" /> <br />
        He puts in nice smooth rounds.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="36md.jpg" /> <br />
        Me a little far out of the saddle, eager to do the combination.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="37md.jpg" /> <br />
        Happy he didn't care about the towers, but a bit too close to this jump
        and it came down.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>

        Balancing himself for the next fence.</div>

        Hard to believe we were at the Championships.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="43md.jpg" /> <br />
        I love how he reaches with his front end over the fence.</div>
