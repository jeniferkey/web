        I decided the day before, that we'd go, and I'd stay on, even if he
        was prancing and eager.<br /> There was some sideways trotting to the warm up area, but
        with direction from the ground,<br />we got through the warm up ok.

        I think I was pretty solid in the tack,<br /> but I wasn't so good about giving as much
        as I
        needed to up to and over the fences.<br />
        He had fun most of the time, and I was gasping for air less as the ride went on.</font></font></center>

    the jump. Again, I can see that I'm pulling before we land, but I didn't trust that
    he wasn't using the jump as an excuse to take rein and go. Instead there was a leap
    or two with his head between his legs right before we kicked on into our canter.
    One or two I can take. I was actually laughing a bit afterwards. Mostly glad he
    listened and went on. We went and finished up over the two coops he'd refused earlier
    in the woods. In the end, he probably told the other horses it was his idea to go
    over them. Either way, I got what I wanted.</font></center>
