up being a bit more refined than what would match his body, but I'll wait
and see on that. I hope to get some more ground work on him this fall/winter
so his topline can start to develop properly.</font></center>

respect for fences, and occassionally jumps from pasture to pasture if
the hay man's coming and he wants to see what's going on....</font></center>
