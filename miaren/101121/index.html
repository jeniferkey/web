    I was reminded this weekend that I hadn't updated Miaren's page lately.<br />
       We've been taking lessons (mainly dressage) two or three times a week, 
    <br />
    so I thought I'd try and grab pictures during one.<br /> 
       Miaren is doing really good. He's a fun ride, although we still have our moments.<br />
            The lengthen is coming along nicely, but the canter still needs a lot of work.<br /> 
            This lesson he lugged quite a bit, so I had to learn more options for getting what I want without fighting him. <br />
            Not easy, but worth it.<br />
<br />

        Studs for any ride I plan to canter<font face="Arial,Helvetica">. They make me feel
            more secure and not worry about slipping.</font><br />

  <div class="right">
      <img src="002.jpg"  alt="" />Forward is rarely an issue for him. Sometimes staying
      in the walk takes tact, but this ride he was feeling lazy and sluggish.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">
  <img src="003.jpg"  alt="" />
    He's expressive with his nose. Softening isn't always his favorite thing to do.<br />
</div>

  <div class="right">
  <img src="005.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;His trot tends to be light and bouncy. I can see
      I shouldn't be hunched so much, but I can also see what I usually feel in the saddle.<br />
  </div>
</div>

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="006.jpg"  alt="" />
        He can be too bendy, and use that to hollow and not reach over the top. Definitely
        a work in progress. Lately he's shown that if I can keep my hands steadier at the
        trot, he can reach through and be steadier. What a concept.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="007.jpg"   alt="" />
      Sometimes I choke up too much. I forget he needs the length of rein to reach forward,
      and I get nervous when he gets rushy.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="008.jpg"  alt="" />Bending and circles are so useful for both of us. The help
        me relax, and let him focus while getting less bored.</div>

      <img src="009.jpg"   alt="" />
      It looks a bit on the forehand, but his underneck is soft and he's more through.
      Here's where my trainer wanted me to try pushing him on to get the backend more
      engaged. I didn't really have the strength that night.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="010.jpg"  alt="" />
        A little canter to see if that would wake him up.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="011.jpg"   alt="" />
      Gritting my teeth as the nose went out and I had little to do to fix it.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="012.jpg"  alt="" />
        Not a bad frame, but he was in a 'just good enough' mode last night. And how many
        years have I been working on that right leg?<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="013.jpg"   alt="" />
      Definitely some bracing going on from both sides. (but the right leg has settled
      down a bit)<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="014.jpg"  alt="" />
        Sitting in the saddle and keeping my shoulders back would probably help. Sometimes
        I'm just thinking of keeping that canter going, and balancing for the downhill slope
        of the arena.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="015.jpg"   alt="" />
      I think better with my body. There was a lot of lifting in this canter. It felt
      fun, even though now I see it's not correct.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="016.jpg"  alt="" />
        Well, it did wake him up.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="017.jpg"   alt="" />
      He looks bigger in pictures than I feel when I'm on him.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="018.jpg"  alt="" />
        Now he's starting to work. Still not engaged behind like he can be, but some energy
        there to work with.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="019.jpg"   alt="" />
      And both of us showing that we're getting tired. He could tell I'd been sick all
      week, and was probably feeding off that.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="020.jpg"  alt="" />
        Stupid right leg. These pictures are a good reminder that it's not listening to
        me if I'm not talking to it.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="021.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      Silly horse. He looks so elegant with that lower lip drooping down. He learned that
      from Emma.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="022.jpg"  alt="" />
        And back to work. A little cob action with those knees.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="023.jpg" alt="" />Across the diagonal doing a lengthen. Not easy to grab
      the right moment in the dark. At least I can see that I'm upright, his neck is longer
      and his nose isn't poked out. It's such a cool feeling.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="024.jpg"  alt="" />
        The other way, just straightening out to start the lengthen. Hopefully in the next
        stride his neck lengthened like in the last picture. It's hard to get it all right.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="025.jpg" alt="" />One more try. Again I'm pleased with my position (although
      my mouth could be shut). It looks like doing the lengthen, he has to go more correctly
      over the top to get that flying feeling to work through his back. Maybe we'll try
      this in daylight next time to see if we can get a good shot.<br />
