    I wasn't up to entering the show, but couldn't resist the draw of schooling with the course marked and decked out.<br />
    We also went around the Novice stadium round for practice. There we hit some fences and I was reminded that I really need to take jumping lessons<br />
    if I'm going to go out in public and jump. Miaren had fun and I had more jumps this time where I let him go. That's always a work in progress.

            roading on Thuy that morning for a couple hours. Miaren had tons more energy than

      Reminding him how we jump together. I don't think I've jumped him all summer. He
      did go out with Emily aboard a few weeks earlier and had fun.</div>

      Wheee! It was already set as an oxer, but he decided to go extra long. I love seeing
      his knees to his neck and the stretch and try.</div>

    Big jump and grabbing some mane. I didn't think the Novice cross country looked
    too bad this time. We just need to get together better on the jumping before we
    tackle them.</div>

      I forgot this was 8 and we had a really bad line to it. He was great and still hit
      it in the middle and lined up right before it.</div>

    He refused the first jump on course. It was really inviting, but I think I had too
    much a hold on him. He came around and went right over.</div>

      A better release than the first try. I worry about what he'll do on the landing
      side, but other riders laugh when I mention him taking off. When they ride him they
      have a hard time with forward. I'm content with slow, but need to step it up for
      cross country.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

    I was already intimidated by fence 2, but Miaren said not to worry.</div>

      Looking at him in the pasture I think of him as gawky. Seeing him like this he's
      rather nice.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">

    I might need to shorten my stirrups another hole. At least my feet aren't below
    his belly.</div>

      In the shadows. I forget these are shorter than the Novice jumps we do in stadium.
      They're intimidating with an open field on the landing side.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">

    He cantered into the water, but we lost a little momentum part way through.</div>


  <div class="right">

      So he did his exaggerated trot.</div>
</div>
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="21.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        I love seeing him working correctly over his back and neck.</div>


  <div class="right">

<div class ="container">

  <div class="right">
      <img src="22.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      And the jump right after the water. Not a lot of forward, but he was game.<br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="23.jpg"  alt="" /><br />
        Awkward. We cantered to it, then he slowed when he saw the hill and the next jump.
        He crawled over and tried to go around the hill.</div>


  <div class="right">

  <div class="right">

      I kept him going to the top and he was enthusiastic when he saw the downhill side.<br />

</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="25.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        Not a big effort but being sure to clear it.</div>

      No picture of Miaren showing how much he liked this water jump. We were sauntering
      along and he collapsed his legs and laid down. I was surprised, but still standing
      and got my feet out of the stirrups. I did get him up before he rolled and got the
      saddle wet. Meg said she could see our heads over the rise and then we disappeared.
      I guess he was getting hot.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="26.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      This was at the top of a hill. We fussed with each other on the way and he did this
      twice. I wasn't holding him, but by time we got to the top he was running out of
      gas. He also didn't seem to care that he had to drag his hind legs over.</div>


  <div class="right">

    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="27.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        So I got a good canter, but also told him to keep his head up and not dive.<br />
 
    <br />
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="28.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      Finally he gave it the effort it deserved. Meg said for a jump that I said I didn't
      want to do, I sure jumped it a lot.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">

  <div class="right">
      <img src="29.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      He didn't completely trust the bridges.</div>

<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="30.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        Down banks have been an issue in his past. They've also not been an issue at all,
        at times. I don't think they worry him, but they're an excuse for him to test his
        rider. This day I had time and I knew I'd get him down.<br />
 
    </div>


  <div class="right">

  <div class="right">
      <img src="31.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      I'd guess it was at least 10 minutes, but we'd do leg yields and trot circles and
      then I'd ask him to do the bank. When he refused we went back to the dressage work.
      His leg yields were very nice and when he pawed with frustration at the last leg
      yield I knew he was ready to give in.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="32.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        No hesitation when I presented him this time. Anything to stop doing dressage work
        with fun jumps all over the place. Silly horse, don't you know I'm more stubborn
        than you are?</div>

      A nice easy jump to remind him how much fun this is.</div>

        Real energy on the last fence. I was worried I was tiring him out, but he was still
        eager to go at the end. I was so glad we did everything on the course. Now it's
        back to dressage for us.</div>
