has had Miaren for the past month.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This weekend was a schooling
show, so they went in the two intro</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>classes. Miaren was great
about the whole thing.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He was eager to be around
the other horses, but listened to Emily</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and only once pulled strongly
to try and talk to another horse (Emily didn't let him).</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>His score sheets were great.
Alternating calm and obedient almost every line.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>They got a 3rd and a 2nd
with seven horses in both classes. His scores averaged</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>around a 60, and we know
what they need to work on, but calm and obedient</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>is more than we hoped for
his first time out.</font></font></center>
