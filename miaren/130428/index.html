<span style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold;">Beginner Novice Event
at Curragh<br />
</span><br />
Our dressage went great. Our last test we'd had energy that the judge
liked, but it was on the edge of control. This test we were relaxed,
but energetic. <br />
It was probably our best test so far.&nbsp; His canter transitions were
exactly what I wanted, no going above the bit, and we got an 8 on our
walk.<br />
Our score was a 29.5.<br />
<br />
I was a little nervous about stadium for the first time in the pelham.
Meg has pushed that I can't interfere over fences and this was out in
the open field, <br />
so I wasn't sure how it would go. We were together on our spots and I
gave over the fences. <br />
We got a little out of sync at one point, but I balanced at the next
fence and we were back together.<br />
We got all our leads and I rode our turns as instructed by using my
outside aids and not pulling with the inside rein.<br />
He just played over the jumps, and the one time he tried to put his
head down he couldn't, so he just kept going.<br />
<br />
I was eager to see how cross country went in the pelham. Our plan was
to canter the entire course, because we'd never accomplished that
before.<br />
We'd moved up to Novice last year, but had refusals, time penalties and
eliminations. This time around we wanted to make it easy to go clear, <br />
so I could focus on making time. He came out of the starting box at a
canter, then squealed, which surprised me, <br />
and I dropped my aides, so he dropped to a trot. I immediately asked
for the canter again, and we were off.<br />
He settled after the first fence and by the third he was offering to
gallop. I wanted to just balance over my feet and let him go, <br />
but I wasn't at that point. I did let him stretch out between the
jumps. He nicely came back at each fence to balance <br />
and I was thinking 'whee' in my head as we headed back toward the water
to let him know that he was doing great.<br />
<br />
I didn't have a watch, so we weren't sure how my time went until they
posted. We went 3:45 and 4:17 was the time. <br />
The cut off for time penalities was 3:34, so we made good time at a
speed where I was still holding him back some.<br />
The nice part was that when I got off I didn't collapse. I was tired,
but not like in the past with him. <br />
I wasn't fighting because my half halts went through, and he couldn't
take off with me after every fence, so my adrenaline wasn't exhausting
me. <br />
So, we finished on our dressage score, which kept us in 1st for the
show. Finally I can't wait to go cross country on him again.<br />

I like how cute he looks using his neck. I'll spend the next month
working on my position.</div>

I rode each fence and didn't jump ahead, so I'm not disappointed in my
position. I just want to tweak some things.</div>

When we come in balanced to the fences it almost seems that simply
looking where we're going to go when we land gives us the correct lead.
At least that's how it worked this day.</div>

I think he was a little lazy behind over the shorter fences. His hind
feet weren't always together on the take off. He still reached and
tucked nicely in front, though.</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="container">
<div class="left"> <img src="IMG0474.jpg" alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
I felt the long take off and didn't want to interfere. Again, sloppy
behind for him.</div>

Using the outside rein for the turn and not just pulling in the inside.
Then he slows down and I have to work harder pushing, but it gets that
hind end under us and ready to jump.</div>

That's a lot of reins to deal with, but once we're going I don't think
about it.</div>

I like this picture. First I think his nose is cute, how he uses it as
a part of jumping. Then I'm liking how defensive I am while giving and
allowing. I don't remember hesitation at this fence, but I always want
to be prepared.<br />

The last fence.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="clear">
<div class="container">
<div class="left"> I liked looking at this sequence of approach.<img src="1.jpg" alt="" /><br />
First half halting 2 strides out.<br />
<img src="2.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Then telling him I wasn't going to interfere.<br />
<img src="3.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="4.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Sitting down a stride out to remind him I'm serious.<br />
<img src="5.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="6.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Going to more of a half seat when I feel that he's pulling us to the
fence.<br />
<img src="7.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Hoping he doesn't change his stride, but just staying back and waiting.<br />
<img src="8.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Hands down and back in the saddle.<br />
<img src="9.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Loosening the reins a bit as I start to reach forward for the take off.<br />
<img src="10.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Hips could be further back, but I'm not bothering him.<br />
<img src="11.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="12.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Keeping a feel of his mouth on landing because we're headed for home.<br />
<img src="13.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="14.jpg" alt="" /><br />
<img src="15.jpg" alt="" /><br />
He'd like more rein, but I'm not pulling on him, just waiting him out
while he remembers he can canter rounder than he'd rather as we're
headed downhill and I want him more engaged.</div>
