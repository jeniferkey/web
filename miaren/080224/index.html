Cross Country</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Nero and I were going to
school cross country at a local</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>course, so I threw Miaren
on to get him out and about.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In general, it went very
well. He stood at the trailer while I schooled</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Nero, only neighing every
once in a while.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He was hand walked around
the course, and settled down pretty quickly.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He was a little spooky about
the jumps and everyone running and jumping,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>but after 15 minutes of
walking over down logs, he was searching</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>for stuff to go over and
asking his handler for more.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At that point I got aboard,
and we walked and trotted over the same logs</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>&nbsp;and banks. He was
pretty proud of himself, as was I.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He's learning what he is
capable of and I'm learning to trust him.</font></font></center>
