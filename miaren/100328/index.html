<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Video of Miaren Training/Jumping</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My first time jumping him since I've been
back riding him.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's rather interesting, because he doesn't
jump like my other horses.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He's so forward and loves long spots.
My trainer doesn't want me interfering</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">before the jumps, so most times I had
no clue where we were going to take off.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thuy is forward to his fences, but he
gets much closer and doesn't fly over nearly</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">as much.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The first video is just us walking and
trotting and working to get him to give to the bit and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">try to stay steady. This is an on-going
project, but I didn't want to get too stuck in dressage,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">so I put on the jumping saddle to let
him have some 'play time'.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He'd been jumping with Laura, and just
going over the trot cavalletti made a huge difference in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">his 'bounce' and enthusiasm. He never
landed from the jumps scooting away, and really only got</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">strong and fast over the last jump. He
felt a lot faster, because I'm used to kicking a horse all the way to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the jump (well, not Thuy). Jumping Miaren
really got my heart racing and Meg wanted us to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">see how we worked together.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The main focus on jumping was getting
me to stay in a more defensive, effective, up right position all the way</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to the fence and over. I slowed it down
in the third video, so I can see where I fight to stay upright, but instinctively</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">duck over the jumps. It's a habit that
I need to keep working on.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the second lesson on Nero, it proved
portent. We took a jump, he hit it, got the pole between his front legs,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and went down after the fence. Even with
the forward momentum, I didn't go off while he floundered and got back
up.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Meg cleared out the broken jump, put it
back up, and boy was Nero more careful. At least he learns.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, on to Miaren.</font>
