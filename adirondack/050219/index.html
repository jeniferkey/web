the truck decided</font>

place and worked with Adiron.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He's lunged, worn a bridle and saddle
and ground driven off the halter,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">so this time I drove off the bit and introduced
the idea of a rider.</font></center>

and not worrying about the bit pretty quick. These Haflingers just don't
get so worried. They don't get frustrated when I'm asking them in a new
and strange way. They just keep giving answers until it's the right one.
At that point they get a lot of praise, and we do it again to see if I
get the same answer. At this age, not a lot of repetition. Getting it twice
works for me right now.</font></center>
