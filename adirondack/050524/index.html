<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I've been taking Adiron out to the hunt
kennels to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ride along with the hounds when they walk
out. No pictures,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">because it's off in pastures or down the
road.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'd been thinking of taking him on a hunt
trail ride, so I asked</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chrissie to ride him and see how he felt.
While she was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">riding, I took a few pictures...</font></center>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They had a little excitement after she
mounted up. We aren't sure what upset him (tightening the girth, waving
the whip, Ortho-flex saddle), but she mounted up and cued for forward and
he really stepped off. Very different than any time I've ridden him. She
stopped and had me tighten the girth, and when she asked for forward, off
he went in a canter. She dropped the whip and pulled him to a halt. From
that point on he was back to slow going Adiron. I know I've had other horses
bothered by the way the Ortho-flex moves on their back. Maybe he was startled
by it. I've been riding him in my Isabelle dressage saddle which doesn't
move like this one.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was nice to see that even though he
seemed upset, no bucking or anything I wouldn't want to ride.</font></center>
