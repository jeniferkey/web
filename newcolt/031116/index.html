Day</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We went and loaded up Miaren to bring
him over to our</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">place for a while. He was hesitant about
getting in the trailer, but</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">trusted us (and liked the food incentive).
I loaded him a couple of times,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">then we shut the door and headed home.
He travelled well and unloaded</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">like he'd been doing it every day.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The electric fence was a puzzler, and
he touched it at least 3 times. The other horses</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">watched from the second pasture, and made
ugly faces to tell him that they were the boss.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We let him and Thuy together for a short
while, and Thuy chased him down a number of times.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Basically he kept Miaren away from 'his'
hay... After about 1/2 an hour we put Thuy back with Bob</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and let Miaren settle in for the night.</font></center>
