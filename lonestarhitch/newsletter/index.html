March 30, 2003
<p>Dear Friends,
<br>On Friday March 29, 2003 I got the chance to drive my first performance
since having brain surgery in December.&nbsp; It was a thrill to be back
on the box but it was physically draining.
<br>In January I was contacted by the Trinity River Trials committee with
an invitation to perform at their opening night ceremonies.&nbsp; Never
having been accustom to turning down the opportunity to drive my horses
in public, I accepted the invitation.&nbsp; Through discussions it was
decided that I would open the show with a tribute to America and raising
the flag for the national Anthem.&nbsp; I informed the chairperson that
as I had been incapacitated for quite some time my horses were not pretty
and slick as I normally have them.&nbsp; I suppose for lack of anything
better to fill the slot the chairperson stated that that wasn't a problem.
<br>I began to make plans knowing that as I approached the date I would
have to have the horses as close to performance ready as I physically could.&nbsp;
As we all know, the best-laid plans never seem to work.
<br>Days I had designated as "working horses days" came and went with the
horses not being worked.&nbsp; Obligations that seemed more important than
that took precedence.&nbsp; Of course one reason why I enjoy draft horse
so very much is that they can be depended on so much to do what you expect
them to do (that is if you have the right horses.&nbsp; Of course some
people just think I'm crazy because I trust my horses so very much.)&nbsp;
The problem with this idea, however, is that two of the horses I would
have to use hadn't been hooked in over a year.&nbsp; Of course having my
dependable lead team sooths the mind, as they are definitely trustworthy
in all circumstances.
<br>This past Monday I began to plan days to wash and clean horses and
equipment. The weatherman began to say that a cold front was coming in
so my days of prep work begin to grow shorter.&nbsp; Thursday was the last
warm day so I pulled all the horses in and started the arduous task of
washing (it didn't use to be arduous).&nbsp; It took me every bit of 6
hours to finish the task.&nbsp; I was physically exhausted at the end of
the workday but as always I had Friday night to look forward to.
<br>Sure enough, the next day saw cold and windy weather.&nbsp; Boy am
I glad I gook advantage of the one warm day. Of course Horses are not the
only things that has to be prepared for a gig.&nbsp; I hadn't driven the
semi since before my surgery so I took it out for a spin.&nbsp; Everything
seemed to go good except for the lights on the trailer (now how many of
you have ever had trouble with lights on the trailer!)&nbsp; Some three
hours later I found the very small exposed wire that was causing the short
so we were all ready to go.
<br>Friday arrived and early morning chores were tackled.&nbsp; Always
on these days the horses know that something is up.&nbsp; They got right
into the groove just as though they had not had a vacation.&nbsp; By the
time I finished the mane, tail and body trims there was enough hair on
the alleyway floor to stuff a mattress.
<br>We arrived at the location around 5 p.m.&nbsp; All of the usual tasks
were done (unloading horses and equipment, braiding manes and tails, etc.&nbsp;
About&nbsp; 5:40 I noticed that I had forgotten the American flag.&nbsp;
I immediately began to panic, as without the flag the performance was useless.&nbsp;
My sister always helps us at these events so she volunteered to run home
and get the flag.&nbsp; The rest of the crew continued the prep work.&nbsp;
At 6:45 the director of the evening event was contacted and arrangements
were made to delay our performance by 10 minutes.&nbsp; We sat at the back
of the alleyway hoping and praying that the flag would arrive.&nbsp; Just
as the announcer began to read the introduction my sister arrived with
Old Glory.&nbsp; A gentleman standing by watching jumped in and assisted
my son in placing the flag on the pole.&nbsp; As soon as I knew the flag
was on the pole I began my run down the alleyway with my son still in the
back of the wagon securing the flag.&nbsp; I don't know how he did it but
by the time I entered the arena he was on the seat beside me.&nbsp; It
was definitely a "sitting on pins and needles" moment.
<br>It felt great to have the lines in my hands.&nbsp; During my hospital
stay I worried that I'd never be able to drive again.&nbsp; Here I was
not only driving but also performing as my horses love to do.
<br>Our initial song was John Wayne's "Why I Love Her".&nbsp; I kept to
the rail most of the time but towards the end of the song I began to move
the horses in a side pass potion to the right and left.&nbsp; They responded
great.&nbsp; As the song ended we stopped in the center of the ring for
the presentation of the flag.&nbsp; (We've done this a lot in the past.&nbsp;
I have an electric motor the raises the flag up out of the wagon as the
Anthem begins).&nbsp; When the song reaches the point of "…and the rockets
red glare…" I put the horses in motion.&nbsp; With the flag flying from
behind the seat I went to the rail performed a figure 8 (almost) and then
went into small circles.&nbsp; At the end I decided to do a spin the top
(360-degree turn.)&nbsp; In this maneuver the wheel horses are so very
important.&nbsp; As the leaders get tighter and tighter in the circle the
front of the tongue is pulled into the horse on the outside of the tongue
(left or right horse depends on a left or right turn).&nbsp; I was going
to the right, which was into the horse that I'd never had on the tongue
before.&nbsp; He's a big stout horse so pulling him over would take a lot
pull by the lead team.&nbsp; The problem was that I had my leaders tighter
than I had meant to which means that the tongue was really pushing the
right-hand wheel horse too much.&nbsp; This horse proved his worth by staying
on his feet and working hard to keep up with the lead team. Grabbing lines
I managed to pull out of the circle and everything was fine.&nbsp; It's
an easy mistake to make anytime but as this was my first time out since
surgery I was extremely happy that all went well.
<br>It was a great night.&nbsp; I was so exhausted when it was over my
crew had to do most of the work back at the trailer.&nbsp; Most of today
has been spent getting my strength back.
<br>There is nothing like driving a multiple hitch of draft horses that
have heart.&nbsp; I thank the Lord that he has given me at least one more
chance to experience the thrill.
<br>Ken
