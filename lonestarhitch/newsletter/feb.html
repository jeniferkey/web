February 20, 2003
<p>In my last newsletter I told you of my ordeal that began back in November
of 2002.&nbsp; I'm happy to report that the situation has changed dramatically
for the good. On Feb 3 I had my first post-operative MRI. My internal doctor
determined that the scan was good enough news that she could take me off
the intravenous&nbsp; antibiotics and put me on oral treatment.&nbsp; That
was great news but she confused me.&nbsp; I asked about the second abscess
and she stated that she didn't know what I was taking about.&nbsp; She
took a second look at the scan and shrugged her shoulders and stated she
didn't know what I was talking about.&nbsp; Well I was very confused.
<br>Yesterday was my second post-operative visit with the neuro surgeon.&nbsp;
I asked him about the abscess that remained in the brain.&nbsp; He stated
that it was gone.&nbsp; In shock I said, " You're telling me that the abscess
we've been fighting is no longer there?"&nbsp; He said, "Yes, I'm telling
you that!"&nbsp; He then took me to the pictures and showed me where it
had been and where is "wasn't" now!&nbsp; He read the radiologist's report
that stated that the area was free from the abscess.&nbsp; What a wonderful
day that was!
<br>In all the joy I do have to remember, however, that I'm still not back
to normal and probably will never be 100%.&nbsp; The pictures also showed
some swelling still existing in the area where the larger abscess was removed.&nbsp;
This will affect my motor and vision skills for a time but all the doctors
feel that time will heal (or redirect) the deficiencies and I will lead
as normal a life as possible.&nbsp; I'm already doing catch-up work around
the house.&nbsp; I've needed to fix some plumbing ever since I went into
the hospital.&nbsp; That got done this past week.&nbsp; I've been painting
the new dove loft that a friend built for Shirley and best of all I worked
a team of horses on Tuesday of this week.&nbsp; Harnessing was exhausting
but driving was fun. I didn't notice that the horses had forgotten anything
and I didn't notice that I had forgotten anything.&nbsp; We are all in
the same "shape" though.&nbsp; They were sweaty and I was tired when we
got back home.&nbsp; But it was worth it for me.&nbsp; I intended to work
them some more this week but the weather has turned bad.
<br>I have to be cautious whenever I'm out.&nbsp; I still have balance
problems and my vision is not 100%.&nbsp; I have been given permission
to drive but cautioned not to take a "cross-country trip".
<br>Thanks to all my friends for their prayers and thoughts during this
time.&nbsp; I couldn't have done it without your support.&nbsp; I continue
to look forward to the day when I will have the hitch back on the road.
