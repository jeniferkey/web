Newsletter
<br>January 15, 2003
<p>Dear Friends,
<br>Yes, it's been years since I've written a newsletter.&nbsp; My intent
when I first put it up on my web site was to keep you informed about our
activities.&nbsp; As you've noticed by the old letter I haven't been very
good at that.
<br>I'd like to say it's because I've been so busy but in reality it's
because I've been so lazy.&nbsp; I've stayed as busy with the horses as
I've wanted to but not as much as I have in past years.&nbsp; Finding help
and the state of the economy really put the bite on travel.&nbsp; My wife,
as you know, is a full time teacher and my son just completed his junior
year at college.&nbsp; I can't travel without their help.
<br>I have been busy here at home with the normal local appearances.&nbsp;
Instead of one Santa parade this year we did two.&nbsp; Free rides at Christmas
On The Square were given for our 13th or 14th year and our second year
of Christmas light tours in Old Weatherford was again a big success.
<br>As you can see by the cover picture of the web site, Casey has been
doing the driving lately.&nbsp; He has done a fine job.&nbsp; Robert Lewis
of Bandera, Texas assisted Casey in the parade this year (Robert is responsible
for teaching me how to drive 14 years ago).&nbsp; This was Casey's first
solo driving appearance.
<p>The main reason Casey is doing the driving right now is that I've just
been through a harrowing ordeal.&nbsp; On Dec 3, 2002 I underwent surgery
to remove a brain abcess.&nbsp;&nbsp; After spending 12 days in ICU and
17 additional days in the hospital I'm doing great.&nbsp; My situation
now is just as mysterious as at the beginning of this journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To this day no one knows how or why the abcess got into my brain.&nbsp;
During surgery, it was determined that a second abcess was inoperable so
it remains in my brain today.&nbsp; Control of this abcess is by intravenous
antibiotic treatment every six hours.&nbsp; Until it is determined through
MRI's that the abcess has disappeared I must continue the treatment.&nbsp;
Hopefully the next scan will tell us that it HAS disappeared and I can
return to a normal life.
<br>This has affected me in that I can't drive vehicles or horses.&nbsp;
The only lasting effect that doctors can see right now is my vision.&nbsp;
They don't know exactly what my problem is so until that's been determined
I can't drive.
<br>So you see, Casey has had to take up the reins and do my job.&nbsp;
For the events that were already scheduled before my ordeal, he responsibly
organized friends and family to help him fulfill my obligations.&nbsp;
It's heartwarming to know that in a time of trouble there are people that
will give above and beyond their duties to help out.&nbsp; That's the one
thing I've learned about driving people and the one thing I enjoy the most
about being around them.
<br>Hopefully I'll be able to keep up with my newsletter now.&nbsp; Lord
knows I've got plenty of time on my hands for a while.
<br>Sincerely,
<br>Ken
<br>&nbsp;
