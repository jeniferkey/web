<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Kanuk's first weekend
roading he had stayed in the pasture and watched everything. The second
weekend I led him along with the first pack and rode him the second time.
This Saturday was the first time he trailered in the morning of, got tacked
up and went out without any warm up. He loaded up nicely at home and just
had a little sweat from the trailer ride. He went out for a little walk/trot
with the first group of horses that arrived, and then the hounds were brought
out and we followed along behind.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The first group of hounds
was a bit naughty, so we were all quite tired by time they came back to
the kennels.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>With the excitement of the
first group, I did see where our threshold was for nervousness and excitement.
He was great for people cracking whips and yelling and hounds running.
He was pretty patient as we waited for the hounds to come in. What was
a bit much were other horses checking in and then leaving again. This,
combined with his horse buddy getting excited, hounds starting to pop back
out of the woods, and my nervousness at all the action, caused him to do
some dancing underneath me. At that point I got a header and got off to
walk him back up the trails.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For all that, the best part
was that he walked easily and calmed down immediately. I was able to get
back up and continue to ride him for the rest of the day. He didn't hold
my nerves against me and we went out with the next group of hounds. Sitting
out in the field talking about how we needed a nap, I didn't notice when
the huntsman sent the hounds off. The pack ran right towards us and all
around us. Kanuk flicked his ears around, but didn't move a foot. These
hounds were equally as naughty, but we didn't have any dancing this time
- the other horses had gone a different direction and didn't distract us.</font></font></center>
