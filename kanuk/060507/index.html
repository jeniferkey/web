<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Not that we didn't get as good of work
or better</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at the show than we did at home, but I
think that</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sitting around between the classes, instead
of walking</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">around and exploring made Kanuk a bit
more nervous.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We blew the second test because he wouldn't
go</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">near the golf cart (judge's stand) - that
we had just gone by numerous</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">times in the first test.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Otherwise, he was a star for me in the
crazy warm up with horses</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">cantering up behind and past him in fairly
close quarters.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No misbehavior and just a little looky
at the strange jumps and people around the ring.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We got a 3rd and 5th, which isn't terrible
for his first out.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Next time we'll do better.</font></center>
