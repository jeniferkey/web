<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We'll start Kanuk out at the beginning
and see where that takes us.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was very obedient about&nbsp; lunging
and offered a few moves that</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">showed us we'll move along fairly fast.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was distracted when his pasture mates
galloped along their fence line,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but it was a windy day and he's getting
to know us. No blow ups and only</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">one break into the canter when his buddies
came running up and surprised him.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The next time we'll lunge in side reins,
and maybe be up on him by the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">end of the session. I want to build his
trust and not throw everything at him</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at once in a new place. It's a method
that has worked well, so no need</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to change it just because we know he's
got more training than the others.</font></center>
