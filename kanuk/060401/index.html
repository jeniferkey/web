Kennels</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Kanuk got to take a ride out to the kennels
this week. I took</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">him the night before roading so I could
see how he settled without</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the excitement of the other horses there.
He was concerned by</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the hounds and distracted by the other
horse, but not to the point</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of acting silly. He tied to the trailer
and was very sweet about</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">tacking up. It was obvious that he was
looking to me for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">comfort and confidence.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That night we got in some lunging and
a short ride, and the next morning he</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">got to see all the horses out. After working
the hounds, Chrissie</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">got a ride in. We agreed he'd stay for
the week to have access</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to the hounds and she'd ride him out when
she had time.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'm hoping that in a few weeks he'll be
ready for me to take him</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on the hunt trail ride. Of course that
means I have to get ride time in on him,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but I'll have him back at home next week,
and daylight savings time is finally here.</font></center>
