<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I figured it was time to see how we did
in the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">jumping saddle. I'm not sure that I'll
have the nerve</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to event or even fox hunt with him, but
there's always</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the chance he will. So, I may as well
introduce him to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">jumping now.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Luckily he likes my Ortho-flex jumping
saddle (not all horses</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">do). I was also pleased that I didn't
feel insecure changing from</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the dressage saddle. I'm sure I was looser,
but Kanuk didn't mind.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hopefully I can get some ground help to
remind me about shoulders,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">heels, elbows and all the things I forget
about when I'm concentrating</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on what the horse is doing (also to set
up some real jumps, so we</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">can progress under supervision).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I've been so excited about how our dressage
work is going that I</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">wasn't really looking forward to the jumping
stuff. After tonight it's a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">real toss up which is more fun. Now I
don't know if I'd rather take</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Moe (who I also jumped for the first time
this week) or Kanuk,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to the first cross country schooling this
fall.</font></center>
