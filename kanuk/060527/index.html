Show</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We went to a schooling show at Fieldstone.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was nervous because it would be our
first time in a covered arena, but not so</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">nervous that I didn't sleep ok the night
before.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I showed him the schooling area and the
ring, and lunged him a bit before</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">preparing to get on. No spooks and he
was so calm on the lunge that it was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">clear he was fine with the show grounds.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My trainer was out for warm up, which
was a huge plus. We warmed up better</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">than we showed, but he was really nice
in the ring. I still had to deal with my nerves, and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">couldn't remember everything we'd worked
on in the warm up.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the two classes we got a 1st and 3rd,
with scores of 69% and 68.5%.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Very exciting, of course.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Outside of the ring, I was pleased to
have the courage to ask for, and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">get a nice canter in the warm up ring.
Not too soon, but we'll be needing</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that canter for training level and above.</font></center>
