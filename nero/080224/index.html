cross country schooling day.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It wasn't a complete success
(I had a case of nerves and</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>had to get off at one point),
but in my favor, I got my nerve back</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and we finished up by jumping
a small line consisting of a jump</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>to a bank. It had been my
goal to do that combination, so</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>with only a slight hiccup,
we had a great day.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Not too many pictures, because
my trainer had to do a lot of hand</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>holding to get us through.
She ended up very pleased. It went better</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>than some XC schoolings
have gone for me.</font></font></center>

learn to jump properly.</font></font></center>
