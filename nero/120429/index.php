        We had a lovely warm up, but right before we went in the ring a horse in the barn
        kicked the wall as we went by. He didn't do a big spook, but he got on alert. So
        there were times in the test when I was pulling more than I should have.</div>

      Turning off the center line and I've got him shorter in front because he was feeling
      a bit rushy to me.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">

        I always need to work on my posture.</div>

  <div class="right">

      He relaxed into the circle and we were heading into a pretty good test.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">  
<div class="left">
  <img src="05.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
    Not the prime posture for a canter transition. Me tense, causing him to be tense.</div>


  <div class="right">

<div class="clear"></div>

  <div class="right">
      <img src="06.jpg"  alt="" /><br />
      We did pretty good, but then he broke to a trot early. He was a bit strong and I
      was trying to half halt to balance him and didn't also keep him engaged. There's
      so much to think about.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">
  <img src="07.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
    He rarely throws his head at the canter anymore, which is so nice for riding. I
    just have to not take advantage of it and give with my hands a bit more now that
    he's got it.</div>

      Nice walk across the diagonal. He was ready for a stretch.</div>
</div>


<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">
  <img src="09.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
    Here's me not prepared for the turn and using the reins more than I should. It's
    always something.</div>

      Funny, I finally felt him relax and then the judge remarks that we need more forward.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">
  <img src="11.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
    I was so pleased that for this little moment I was thinking inside leg to outside
    rein to get the circle and bend right. When I get nervous I tend to forget things
    like that.</div>

      Too fast in the canter. He was ready for the jumps, I guess. I was worried that
      if I half halted we'd trot, so I didn't balance him like I should have.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">
<div class="left">
  <img src="13.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
    A nice turn up the centerline.</div>

      Almost square halt. Really a nice test but we still need to work on the canter.
      We had it in the warm up but I'm guessing my tension during the test gave us the
      speed in the canter.</div>

      Back to my default position when I'm nervous. Hips should be back and hands should
      be forward.</div>

    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">

        More like this. It took me a while to hear what my trainer was saying.</div>

      Trying to quickly show Nero the jumps. It's been a couple of years since we've been
      in a stadium ring and we didn't school the course the day before.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">  

<div class="left">
  <img src="18a.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
    I was prepared for this reaction. He'd done it on cross country the day before at
    a brush jump. I have to be really hesitant for him to refuse, but it doesn't mean
    he trusts the jumps. I think the flowers looked like a turkey laying in wait. We
    don't like turkeys.</div>


  <div class="right">

  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

</div>


  <div class="right">
  <img src="19.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      We cantered the course after the first jump. I was so pleased at his try.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>  
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="20.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        The crowd gasped at a few of our jumps. My stirrups got loose on the first fence,
        but I stayed tight.</div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 

<div class ="container">

  <div class="right">
      <img src="20a.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      This one was a refusal the first try. I went into it thinking it would be and as
      we cantered, then trotted to it I looked at the jump as much as Nero did. I didn't
      use the whip at all. I knew it would be a big jump and wasn't determined to go over
      it until we turned around and came at it again.<br />
      It was a combination and he jumped to the right, so I was trying to get him straightened
      in the air so we'd hit part B in the middle. Not sure it was the right call, but
      we did hit the second one nicely.</div>
</div>

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="21.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        Looking toward the next jump and him taking this one nicely in stride.</div>

<div class ="container">

        We were both finally relaxed and he understood what was happening.</div>

      Nice easy jump over the last fence.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="25.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        After the big jumps in stadium I was rather nervous about the first fence on cross
        country.</div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">

    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="26.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      He jumped higher than the brush, but just.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="27.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        In my mind I was telling him we were going after the hounds. Usually the only time
        we canter in a field is out fox hunting.</div>


  <div class="right">
    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>


  <div class="right">
      <img src="28.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      More effort than needed, but ears pricked and not worried.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="29.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        He asked if I was sure I wanted to canter downhill.</div>
  <div class="right">    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>
  <div class="right">
      <img src="30.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      I jambed my heels down and asked him to move on.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="32.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        I'd sit up and prepare for every jump. Part way through the course I could feel
        him say what's up, it's just another jump, we can take it in stride.</div>
    <div class="right">    
  </div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>    
    
  <div class="right">
      <img src="33.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      By this time on course he was feeling confident and comfortable.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="43.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        Jumping out of stride and not worried about how much rein he has. He never asked
        to go faster and kept a really nice steady pace the entire time.</div>
      <div class="right">    
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>    
    
  <div class="right">
      <img src="42.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      I was getting tired by this point but he took care of things.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="35.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        If I sat up too sharply in a half halt before the fence he'd ask right away if I
      wanted him to slow up. And I'd have to put on a bit of leg and tell him he was doing
      fine.</div>
      <div class="right">    
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>    
    
  <div class="right">
      <img src="36.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      We cantered almost to the waters edge and then he slowed down right as we got to
        it. I was tired and let him walk a couple of steps through before pushing him on
        again.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="37.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        He's used to slogging through water out hunting. I do think he was a little unsure
      why we went through and not around when there was a whole field available.</div>
  <div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  
    </div>    
    
  <div class="right">
      <img src="39.jpg"   alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
      It was a warm and windy day, but I don't think he broke a sweat except under the
      tack. It really wasn't a lot of saddle time for him compared to a hunt.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div> 
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="40.jpg"  alt="" /><br />
        I was trying to judge when we were a few strides out for sitting back in the saddle
        before the fence. I didn't want him to have any excuse and I was still riding my
        jumps defensively.&nbsp;</div>

      Last jump and on our way home. My first cross country course in years where I didn't
      have time penalties.</div>
