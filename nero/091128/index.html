time watching for hounds and do an occasional trot circle to keep him entertained
(and I've taken to carrying sugar to reward him for helping me get gates
without getting off).</font></center>

can get anxious away from all his buddies, but his anxious means a head

we watched the huntsman and field canter/gallop off, I wasn't sure what
to expect. He wasn't asleep to them leaving, but he obligingly turned around
and went back to standing at our post.</font></center>

it's more work to get him to listen to my instructions.</font></center>
