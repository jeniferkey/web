<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We've gone to a couple of schooling days
this month.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nothing big, but working our way up. This
last time he</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">may have known what was coming up, because
he got</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">over excited in the warm up. After his
front feet left the ground</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I got off and did the lunging bit, then
he got to walk around</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">while the others jumped. He did settle,
and we ended up having</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a great ride. My trainer says he's still
young to this, and I know</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">how Thistle can get when he gets excited.
Something I'll</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">have to consider when taking him out.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Maybe living alone for the past few weeks
isn't best. He maybe got out</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">with the other horses and expected it
to be play time. He and Thistle might</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">get to work each other's energy out before
they go out for hunting</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">this season.</font></center>
