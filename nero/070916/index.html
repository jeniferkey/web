and I showed Training Level Test 1 and 2 this weekend.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We received a 3rd and 6th, and I couldn't
have asked for better.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was calm off the trailer, not worried
in the ring, no spooks and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we had a decent warm up. I'm sure we'd
have done better with</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a trainer on the ground, but there's only
so much I can remember to do in</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a test, anyway. Our scores were both 56s,
so we definitely have things to work</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on (canter), but our placings put us in
the middle of the group. So, we're pretty much</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at the same place as others in our area
working at this level.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We missed our first lead, but he let me
correct it. I was a bit panicky asking for the canters,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">so they were messy. But, he always picked
them up when I asked. It was a very good day.</font></center>
