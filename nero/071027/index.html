buck at one point (might be in this picture). The people in front were
trotting on, and we broke into a nice canter behind them.&nbsp; I slowed
up a bit for the horse behind me, then we cantered on to catch up. As we
caught up to Thuy we did some sort of leap and I felt a little out of control.
Obviously from the picture we got pretty close to Thuy. I'm not sure if
Nero was trying to keep cantering, or if I got a bit grabby with my hands
as we closed in on the group.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It startled me, but didn't unseat me at
all. If it happens again, and there's the room, I think I'll try a circle
instead of abruptly slowing up. Of course I didn't think of that at the
time.</font></center>

so I can maybe test the other jumping saddles. His next outing should be
the hunting clinic at a local cross country course. I'm hoping my nerves
are around for that day. It could be a lot of fun.</font></center>
