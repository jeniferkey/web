</span><br />
    Nero was great schooling the course the day before. No stops at the beginner novice jumps.<br />
    The day of the show he was a bit tired from the day before. 
    <br />
    His dressage was really nice, the comments mostly pointed to work on our canter, which is always something we need to work on.
    <br />
       He got a 38.6 and we were in 5th place in a group of 10.
    <br />Out jumping he warmed up well, but on the course, by the 8th jump or so, he was getting tired. We had one stop on course.  
    <br />
    I was pushing a bit to the jump and he just didn't see the same spot as I did. We came back around and he jumped it fine.<br />
    At the water he slowed to a walk where the day before we cantered it. But, he was still game for the last 1/2 of the course and we only broke to a trot a couple of times.
    <br />With the refusal we came in 6th place. The rain kept it cool, although a bit humid and it was really a fun day.

        We play at a lot of different things, so his dressage isn't as far along as Miaren.
        Still, he's pretty steady, which goes a long way.</div>

        He can have more energy (we got an 8 on our very forward entry), but I forget to
        keep him as engaged as I should.</div>

        He offered the stretch and was loose, but he didn't stay connected the entire diagonal.</div>

      He was responsive for the upward, but maybe a little above the bit.</div>

        His canters aren't that balanced. It's a lot more controlled than it used to be,
        but he's a big horse and we don't work on his canter as much as we should.</div>

      Our last show he broke to a trot in the canter. Now I wear spurs so I can remind
      if I need to.</div>

        A shot of me being a bad rider. Last week on Miaren I was so careful to put my leg
        on for the downward and use my back and seat to transition. Here's what happens
        if I don't think. Bracing the leg and pulling with the hands. Obviously no muscle
        memory there.</div>

      Nicely, for us, into the canter. No head toss and lifting in front.</div>

        I was really happy with his right lead canter. But he did get a little strong on
        the long side.</div>

      Maybe the biggest jump on course. He really tried over it. Yes, I got a little loose,
      but I gave him enough rein to use his head as much as he needed.</div>

    A little run down hill. It was raining a bit, but I don't&nbsp; remember anything
    feeling slick.</div>

      There was a little hesitation at the bottom of the hill before jumping this. I think
      he wanted to be sure he had the right spot. There were a few refusals at this one.</div>
</div><div class="clear"></div>   
  <div class ="container">

      Another good jump.</div>
</div>
<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        There were a number of turns on the course.</div>

      This is after a stop and we were coming again. Might not be the best time to be
      kicking him on - a stride out - but I wanted him to go over.</div>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        And he did nicely.</div>

      Every time I have a refusal I wonder if I'll ever get the horse over. Here's relief
      that he went.</div>

<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        Giving him encouragement to gallop on. There was a lot of space between the fences.</div>

      He felt a canter was good enough for the day. I've had him in a 'bubble' bit with
      a little more leverage for a few years. It was a mental thing for me, so today I
      switched to his simple snaffle in hopes it would encourage him to be more forward
      and would be more forgiving if I forgot to give forward with my hands.</div>

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        Most of the course he was on a fairly light rein. He doesn't make me nervous the
        way Miaren does. If I make a mistake Nero tends to be much more forgiving.</div>

        I cantered this the day before, but today he slowed to a walk and tried to stop
        part way in. Afterwards he drank a lot of water at the trailer which made me wonder
        if he was thinking like a hunt horse that if we go in water we stop and pause for
        a drink if we want. Funny what we teach without knowing.</div>

      A couple of thwacks with the whip and he realized I at least wanted him to keep
      walking. I did use it to take a breather for myself, too,
      though. At this point
      I wasn't supporting him too much.</div>

<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">
  <img src="23.jpg"  alt="" />&nbsp;<br />
        We had to pick up a trot part way through so we'd have some impulsion for the jump
        a couple of strides out.</div>

        I'm starting to go back to default jumping position with my hands not giving, but
        I think I at least left the reins long.</div>

      Umm, maybe flapping my elbows a bit. I'm supposed to stay still and aerodynamic,
      but I forget that when we're cantering up a hill and I know we need to keep the
      energy going to make it over the jump at the top.</div>

<div class="clear"></div>   

<div class ="container">
    <div class="left">

        He politely jumped, using himself nicely.</div>

      Yesterday we cantered up and down and it felt like a roller coaster. Today he didn't
      care if I encouraged him to canter, he was going to trot and keep his balance to
      the bottom. He did canter the last two fences after this for
        me. Although from the
      last fence to the finish line he was content to trot and I wasn't going to persuade
      him otherwise.</div>
