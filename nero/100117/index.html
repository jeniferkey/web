<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's been a couple of years since we've
shown. This past</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">fall and winter we've been fox hunting
most weekends, or</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at least going out with the hounds at
the kennels.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No jumping schooling the day before, but
I did ride in the dressage saddle at the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">kennels. This shows me that for better
dressage scores, we need to do</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">some arena work before a show. We got
a 41%, which wasn't bad for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">our up and open look in the test.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our dressage scores were better two years
ago, but I love comparing the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">jumping pictures. He still went around
the ring a bit confused, and didn't</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">'get' the idea of doing a stadium round,
but so much more relaxed at the idea</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of jumping whatever ended up being in
his way.</font></center>
