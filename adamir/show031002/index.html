<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(We were 4th after dressage with a 38.5.
Unfortunately we had</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a refusal in stadium. Cross country he
was great, and even forward</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for the last half. My trainer told me
to trot down the bank into the water.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well, Adamir thought leaping into the
water would be much more fun. We</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">had a couple of awkward jumps on cross
country, but once he got rolling</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we flew over the course. We did have 15
seconds of time penalties,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but we had a clear round over our first
Novice cross country course!)</font></center>
