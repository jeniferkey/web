first Beginner Novice fence, I asked if, and my trainer agreed that, I
could jump some of the Novice fences. Well, we ended up jumping the Novice
course instead of the Beginner Novice.&nbsp;</font></center>

we are going. He hesitated the first time at this drop, because we came
up onto the bank, and then I asked for a turn to the left and jump down
a stride away from the drop. The second time I made a very wide turn so
he could see the drop coming up and he was happy to do it.</font></center>

when she saw how good our jump was going to be and almost forgot to take
the picture)</font></center>

faults, but by this time, after cross country, he was so tired. I let him
trot some of the fences and just nursed him around the course. I can really
see the benefit of an event being spread over two days. Oh well, we'll
just have to do some more conditioning...</font></center>
