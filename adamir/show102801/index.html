<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Well, it was one of 'those' shows. Actually
a wonderful day, with</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">some really fun moments. We were first
after dressage in our division,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and stayed there after stadium. Then,
I messed up on cross country.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was getting tired and really starting
to trust Adamir to just jump.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We did one second part of a little combination
with me trying to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">separate mane from reins, and as we headed
for home, he just</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">sheared off to the left, around one of
the jumps, darn it! So, one runout</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">which put us down to 5th. My trainer was
very diplomatic and just said that</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I wouldn't make that mistake again. I
feel like I let Adamir down. We were</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">really rolling toward home, and I didn't
sit up and slow him down and present him to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the fence. Well, I guess she's right.
Hopefully I'll focus on every jump next time...</font></center>

trot work. We even got an 8 on his entrance.</font></center>

<center>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica">No trailer-mate this time, but
Adamir was a little distracted in the ring (he bonded with the horse at
the next trailer over). Actually he did the stretchy circle and was neighing
at the same time, but still was stretching. So, he is improving on that
front.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(oh, and I guess I must say that my idea
of distracted compared to others at the show was a bit different. He didn't
look around or spook, but he did still neigh for almost the entire circle.)</font></center>

<td>
<center>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica">An example of having the front
end, but not the back. He no longer hollows (well, not too much), at the
canter, but I need that hind end more engaged so he has balance and doesn't
fall on his forehand or speed up.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The coolest thing happened this weekend.
We were schooling cross country, and I asked for the canter, then put my
leg back and on like my trainer has always told me to, and he engaged his
hind end. It was awsome and scary and powerful. It felt like every stride
he was lifting his shoulders and bringing his hind legs underneath me.
After feeling that support, I almost believe that he could move up the
levels in dressage. The quest will be to get it to translate into his dressage
work.</font></center>

around the stadium course with a huge grin on my face. Our last few stadium
courses have been a little sticky. That lack of impulsion thing. Well,
this time he landed galloping off of some of the jumps. So forward and
up in the front end. I can't remember the last time I rode a horse that
launched over every jump, with his ears forward trying to find another
jump. (btw, the faster you go, the harder it is to steer. Maybe he'll teach
me to look at the next fence while we're jumping the previous - something
my trainer's been working on for years.)</font></center>
