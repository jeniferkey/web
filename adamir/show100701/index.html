I rode 2 horses in 4 tests and 2 jumping rounds. I am definitely not in

by his trailer-mate. We had some good moments, and some not so good. Still,
we had our best score (and ride) for Training Test 3, yet. Novice Test
B wasn't as good as we could have been - neighing for the friend, and Training
Test 4 was better than the last time, but, again would have been better
if he hadn't been thinking about his friend.</font></center>

to have impulsion (something that was always missing from our previous
tests). It translated to the show.</font></center>

tests. The judge recommended that I think of the downward transitions as
upward transitions, so that I continue to push him into the transition

not just make Adamir really confused...</font></center>

got the neck 'unlocked', where he'll lengthen his neck and push forward
into the bridle, I'm almost thinking, why did I do that, when I'm just
going to be asking him to lift it all back up (actually, I believe in the
stretching down to build the topline, and feel that I should be able to
ask him to put his head anywhere and get a response, not just have him
hold it in a nice headset, like he did before he learned to lengthen and
stretch down).</font>

right elbow strangely, we'll get a better circle...</font></center>

that right toe is pointing out, I must be putting that leg on at the girth.
My right leg never responds properly and I tend to over compensate with
my right hand and arm. After some good suggestions, I've worked at keeping
my elbows in front of my body, but I don't always remember.</font></center>
