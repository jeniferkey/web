We haven't jumped a course this high before, so I wasn't sure. The only
problem we had was a bunch of tight spots. When I remembered (and had the
strength), to keep my leg on, he jumped really smoothly. When I just sat
up there like a bump on a log, he'd tend to chip in. I'm not sure that
it matters to him, if he jumps like a deer, but I'm hoping to explain to
him that jumping out of the canter stride is much nicer.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Someday I'll have more than one jump at
the house, so we can work on this stuff without trailering somewhere.</font></center>

<center>&nbsp;<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This one was a nasty, tight,
deer-jumping fence. It was the last jump on the course, and I was so tired,
all I could do was grab mane and trust him. Hard to believe from this picture,
but he didn't touch it.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I've just got to teach him that as the
fences get raised, impulsion is going to become a requirement for jumping.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think it's more my fault than his. I
can get timid when he gets forward, so, in the past, over the smaller fences,
I've asked him to have little impulsion on the approach, because that feeling
of power was intimidating.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If I'm going to ask him to move up the
levels in the future, I'm going to have to trust his forwardness as necessary
for jumping the bigger stuff.</font></center>
