<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Adamir was just like any other horse at
this schooling day.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No snorting and shying at the galloping
horses (one horse actually</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">snorted and shied at us galloping, ha!)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was nicer to the fences. Not rushing
or pulling, just listening</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and moving off my leg.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was able to relax and look forward to
each jump.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He still needs to trust that jumping from
the canter will work. If I</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">wasn't strong about pushing him to the
jump in the canter, he'd</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">back off and I'd feel some hesitation.
I'm sure it'll come. It didn't take much</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for him to figure out trotting them.</font>

jump off of a sharp turn. I expected him to try to run-out right, so I
kept up my guard, and probably caused the run-out to the left... We just
came right back at it; I kept him straight, and over we went.</font></center>

now. I approached it from far back, with no lead, and he hesitated, but
went in, trotted out, and went over the telephone poles. The second time
we did it at a canter, which was really fun.</font></center>

bit lazy. They're so small I wasn't worried (he never hit anything). I
think it's good that he's learning to only jump as much as he needs to.
It'll help conserve energy when we're galloping the course on event day.</font></center>
