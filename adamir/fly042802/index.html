<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I've gotten tired of using
so much fly spray (and the fact that</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>it doesn't work for very
long), so I've switched to fly sheets.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Because the flies that bother
Adamir seem to go after his legs, I asked</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Mother to sew some leg wraps.
I bought a damaged fly sheet and</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>she cut it up and went after
it with the velcro. I've added to it with</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>suspenders for the front
legs, which go over his back. This helps to keep</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>them up, instead of falling
around his fetlocks...</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He doesn't seem at all bothered
by it. I'm still waiting to see if the leg wraps</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>will hold up, but I'm sold
on the sheet itself. He's been wearing it for about a</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>month now, and his coat
is great with the only bug bite swellings on his neck and legs.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I'm still waiting to see
if the sheet is too hot for real summer wear. If it is, I'll still leave
the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>leg wraps on. When he's
all decked out, he doesn't stomp his front feet, and only uses his</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>back legs to kick at his
belly (maybe a belly band is in his future...).</font></font></center>

<br>His mane seems to protect his neck.&nbsp;

if he's exposed.</center>

<br>Finally found something big enough for Emma. Her nose gets sunburned.
<br>I'm still trying to get her a fly sheet. She isn't so bothered, but
I'm just so
<br>pleased with the idea of protecting without using so much fly spray.
<br>Oh, and I think I figured out how to keep the mask on. I rubber banded
<br>her mane and forelock around the top part of the mask...</center>
