week. Lengthening his walk. My trainer doesn't want him to think that there
is only one speed (for lack of the correct word) at each gait. She had
us work on two speeds at the walk and trot. Steady is wonderful, but we
don't want to make more work for ourselves later when we need to start
explaining the difference between working and medium and lengthening in
the same gait. Plus, shortening and lengthening stride will be necessary
for jumping.</font></center>

close we can get, without going over...</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With one week of consistent work,
he's looking better than this and using his topline more. (Although, the
main fault I see here is that he's braced on my hands and not stretching
his neck out) He's learning that he can balance himself, even if his neck
is stretched out. This will help him build up the muscles in his topline,
so that he can have the strength for more advanced movements.</font></center>

course. After he sniffed it, he calmly stepped over it. By the 8th fence,
he jumped and cantered away. No real urging, just letting him figure the
stuff out on his own. (Note the double mane)</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The last jump on course. Well, kind
of a jump, but he did canter away. We got in one jumping lesson this week,
and after ground poles and building up the session, he eventually trotted
into and cantered through an extremely low in and out. It took a few tries
for him to sustain the canter between the two fences, (he just couldn't
believe that it would work unless he broke down to a trot-figuring out
where his feet were) but when he figured it out, he was straight and forward
and proud of himself.</font></center>
