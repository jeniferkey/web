<center>I compared this picture to one we took about a year ago. I can
see minimal differences (head more on the vertical, maybe more reach underneath),
but riding this walk is so different than a year ago. We can march, and
shorten and lengthen and bend and stretch. It's a world of difference,
but you can't really see it in a picture.</center>

himself more, and lifting his front end more. He's really learning to bend...</center>

<center>I love this. This frame 6 months ago would have been wrong. Now
it works, because if I lengthened the rein, he would stretch his head down
and stay in the balanced trot. 6 months ago, he'd have either put his head
up, or started rushing the trot to keep his balance. We finally have a
balanced, adjustable trot.</center>
