our First Recognized Event</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>(Trinity River Horse
Trials - Beginner Novice)</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My goal was to not be eliminated in the
cross country. I achieved that.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The fences were very scary and it had
rained extremely hard the night before.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many of the riders in the levels above
us scratched from riding the cross country course.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There were a few fences that were at max
height at the top of the solid part. To these</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">they added the extra height of brush,
and one even had a drop after it. The course was designed by Torrance Watkins.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Walking the course I noticed that Novice
jumped all but one or two of our fences and only had a</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">couple of extra of their own that weren't
any taller. Training also jumped two of our fences</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in their course.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We scored 43.5 in dressage under Sally
O'Connor, had three refusals on cross country and two in stadium.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He jumped everything, but really wanted
to stop and look at them first...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was at least a mile from the barns/arenas
to the cross country, including crossing a busy 4 lane road.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When all was said and done, I was thrilled
with our results. We had a great cheering section</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">following us through the event and even
the organizers said how proud they were</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that we stuck with it and finished.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After this weekend, I think I could tackle
anything. I just don't know if I want to...</font>

have a refusal at a huge fence, and then turn and run at it again without
a crop to give a bit of encouragement. Luckily Adamir responds to loud
growling...</font></center>
