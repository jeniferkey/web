Show</font></font>
<br>Judge's comments: Cute horse, willing to go forward. Work on getting
him steady (speedwise and headwise), and work on acceptance of the bit.
<br>It's very possible that I could have left the reins longer and still
kept asking for his head, and not had so much resistance. Or, he could
have taken advantage of the extra rein and just trotted faster and ignored
the transitions. (all of which we got on the letter) My plan is to go back
to the lunge in side reins, and see how resistant he is with a nice length
of rein. I'd like to work through any resistance on the lunge, so that
when I get back on him, my hand is just there to support him, not to fight
with him...
<br>I am hoping that the weather lets me get some more jumping training
in. At the show, which was a Combined Test, I led him over some of the
Elementary jumps, and he followed me over. He's so springy, that he should
like jumping the small stuff. (not like lazy horses that I've had who just
stumble over anything little)</center>
