After the first jump, every time I'd squeeze him into a trot and circle
toward a jump, he'd get so eager. His knees were really tight and we didn't
have any runouts or refusals (I don't count the hay bale jump. We didn't
get close enought to that to call it a refusal).</font></center>

scared of these hay bales. We had gotten to the point on the course that
we weren't showing him the jumps, but just letting him trot up and over.
He wouldn't get near these bales until I walked him up and let him sniff
them (last winter all his hay came in round bales).</font></center>
