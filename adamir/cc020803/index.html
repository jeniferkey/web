level, and was later told they were Training. It's good that these are
starting to look smaller to me.&nbsp;</font>

group not to go off.</font>

fence. Not sure why, but we did get over it after a couple of tries.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have to think that the fox hunting has
helped. We did one gallop after a fence, where I got tears in my eyes.
I was scared, but thought about how it felt when we'd done that hunting
and told him to keep going. He was very responsive, too, and slowed up
immediately, when I asked.)</font></center>
