<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>About 3 weeks ago Emma came
up lame.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>She didn't want to walk
around much, and was head-bobbing</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>lame at the walk on her
right front.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The vet was out, used testers
and said an abcess. He gave her</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>antibiotics and bute for
a week.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I checked on her in another
week, and noticed that a portion of her</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>hoof wall was completely
separated from the hoof. I called my</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>farrier, and we scheduled
for him to come out.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The following shows what
he did.</font></font>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There's still a little
black stuff showing, but hopefully as we treat it, that will all go away.
If not, we will consider digging out more. I find it interesting to see
how thick the hoof wall is this high up. The farrier said that in any healthy
foot, there would have been a lot of blood in this area. Some suggestions
were to cut away until it bled, but we didn't want to go that far.</font></font></center>

like on the ground. The first night I left it open to get air in. In the
morning I had to clean out some dirt, so I'll probably follow the vet's
suggestion of packing with cotton soaked in a bleach solution to try and
kill the bad stuff and keep it cleaner.</font></font></center>

that you can soak the foot without cutting the hoof away, and then see
if it gets better. Then if it doesn't, go ahead and cut away.&nbsp;</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I think if this hadn't been
so far up in the hoof wall, we'd have done that. With how high up this
was, I don't think soaking would have reached the spots that needed healing
without doing what we did. Also reading further, it seems air is very important
to killing the fungus.</font></font></center>

front foot, and there was no separation at her white line on that side.
We tend to think she got a piece of gravel between her wall and hoof and
that could have started all this. We didn't trim the rest of the hoof or
take off any sole or frog. The farrier felt she'd need all the support
that she could get from the rest of the foot. With a nine inch foot, we
didn't really consider shoes.</font></font></center>

softer ground. We're looking into getting her a soaking boot, to let the
foot soak maybe once a week.</font></font></center>
