here.&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She was acting up a bit (look at that
tail), and flinging a bit at the trot. Still, I look at this picture and
say, ok, if she were going straight and not falling in, and were stretching
foward with her neck, and bringing that hind end a bit lower and foward,
that could be a really cool lengthen or even extented trot. And this is
what she does just playing on the lungeline...</font></center>

I'm doing with Adamir, I'm lucky to get on Emma once a week. I also want
to start her right, and my trainer says that means I should have a handler,
just in case, until she responds to my aids on her back, every time. I've
had one horse with a bucking issue, and I never want to create that problem
again.</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She's got a nice, smooth trot, that's
easy to sit, or post. Lots of air time, even when she's just shuffling.
One upward transition, she put in a real trot stride; made me and my trainer
gasp. After the trotting, we went back to walking around the arena, and
there was a noticable improvement in her walk, and in her responsiveness.
Slowly, but surely...</font></center>
