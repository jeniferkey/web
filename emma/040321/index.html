to ride Emma</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We'd been discussing it forever. Emma
is living out at the parents'</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">house and Father has been wanting to ride
her. For his first ride, he</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">wanted me there to supervise the bridling
and saddling.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally last Sunday was good weather and
we got her out and tacked</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">her up. She is just wonderful. No tying
for grooming or tacking, she just</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">stood outside the tackroom while he figured
out the saddle and then came out and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">put it on her. She also stood calmly while
he brought over a chair to use as a mounting block</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and climbed on.</font></center>

They were heading toward the fenceline with the other horses and she started
trotting. Pulling back made her flex, but not really slow down. I'm sure
I was a little panicky when I told him to pull back hard. She stopped immediately.
They turned around, and she started trotting again. I wasn't sure what
was up. I told Father not to squeeze with his legs so much. Then he explained
that since she was slowing down so much, he thought it might be a good
idea to just keep constant pressure with his legs so she didn't slow down.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I said maybe not, and just cluck a little
if she felt like she was slowing down. The rest of the ride stayed at a
walk...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(of course later, when he realized they'd
been trotting, he was disappointed that I hadn't taken any pictures)</font></center>
