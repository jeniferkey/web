I'd say no and make her walk out in a circle. Bart said by the fourth time
she seemed to have caught on and stopped moving (easier to stand still
and let me climb on her, than to walk around in the heat). Toward the end,
I didn't stop for every shift of the foot, because I don't want her to
think that fidgeting will make me get off her.</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Notice the nose. Someone on the internet
suggested mud for itchies, and while I was putting it on Adamir, I thought
it might work for her sunburn. The regular lotion comes off almost immediately.
I know how hard it is to get mud off during the rainy season, so maybe
this will be better than the lotion. I put it on with a paint brush, and
she sort of tolerates it...</font></center>
