We stayed away from the <br />      action and watched from a distance, but raising his head and looking big<br />      were the only signs he was excited when they'd come close.<br />      We had one long trot across a pasture toward the end, and that was the      first time<br />      I felt him relax his back and swing in the trot. But, I never felt him tire      and <br />      he was always happy to move on to the next location.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        He's good for tacking up at the trailer.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /><br />        Waiting to head out. He was good about standing or walking around with        the other horses. We had to be careful <br />        when in the tall grass, but he was very surefooted navigating the rough        ground.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        Watching for the hunt. He's very aware of his surroundings.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /><br />        We hung out with Katie and Bella. Bella was so happy to be out and and        a bit eager. Simon was good even when Bella cantered or trotted past us        when she got<br />        excited. He was good and only cantered when I told him to. Every once in        a while he would pick up a trot without my asking, though.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="05.jpg" /><br />        He is starting to learn a relaxed forward walk, but we had no issue with        him crowding, because he didn't walk as fast as Bella.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06.jpg" /><br />        He is still chubby, but he fit in the smaller sized girth for the first        time today.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="07.jpg" /><br />        Guarding the South and watching the hounds come around to the pond for        water.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08.jpg" /><br />        Catching up to Bella.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="09.jpg" /><br />        Checking for any stragglers at the water.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10.jpg" /><br />        We don't ride on a lot of gravel, but I let him pick his way when we do,        because he's barefoot.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="11.jpg" /><br />        He's a fun little horse.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="12.jpg" /><br />        Working our way through the tall grass he would occasionally grab a        bite, but wasn't pushy about it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="13.jpg" /><br />        I like riding with his mane up so it doesn't get tangled in the double        reins. He still doesn't have a halt off the seat and that second set of        reins on the curb are my emergency brake. I only used it once this ride        when we were coming up to the cattle guard.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="14.jpg" /><br />        Our first gate opening and closing was slow going, but by the last one        he was presenting his left or right side to the fenceline and standing        still while we worked out the chains and latches. I love a horse who's        calm while getting a gate.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>  </body></html>
