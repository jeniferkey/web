<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chrissie and I went by my parents' place
so she could</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">get some training in on Angel. We wanted
to see where</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">she was in her training and how she responded
to work.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First she got lunged. She was a little
distracted by the other</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">horses and sometimes wanted to stop and
talk to them. But,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">not bad for coming off the pasture after
time off.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then Chrissie got on and we went for a
little trail ride away from</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the other horses. I was on Thuy and we
went into the far pasture.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Angel showed us that she didn't think
work was fun and that she wanted</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to see if she could get back to her friends.
No bucking or bolting, but some</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">strong pulling in their direction with
a bit of nervous trotting. It took a little</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">while, but she calmed down and we walked
back quietly. Then we went</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">away again down the driveway and she was
great. I don't think it'll take</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">much to get her back in the groove.</font></center>
