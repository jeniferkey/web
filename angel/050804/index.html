work</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">away from home. The pictures are a bit
dark</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">because it was getting late, but we got
home from</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">work, loaded her up in the trailer and
went out to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the kennels to let Chrissie work her.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was a little touch and go as I unloaded,
because</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the horse at the kennels was plunging
around his pasture</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to say hello. Only one spook from Angel
when the other horse</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">touched his hot wire and came a bit unglued.
I'm sure she thought</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">he was coming over the fence after her.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After 3 minutes, he stopped running and
everything was back to normal.</font></center>

at a couple of scary things, she was great. They went around the woods
a few times and she was always obedient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></center>

the horse in the pasture decided at one point to come out of his run in

needed to get used to it, since it would be similar in the hunt field.
Angel swiveled her ears, but kept on with what she was doing.</font></center>

caught Angel and loaded her up. We were all quite impressed that she sniffed
at the inside of the dark trailer and calmly walked right up. She got a
little fussy when we stood around talking a little long than she thought
we should, but I understand wanting to get home and go to bed.</font>
