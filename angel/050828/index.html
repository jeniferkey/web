<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Angel's First Dressage
Show</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I went a bit crazy and decided
to take two horses to</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>the dressage show. I'd vowed
before to never do it again, but</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I felt pretty confident
with the two I wanted to take. Of course</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>neither had been to a dressage
show before, but why should that</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>stop me?</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Surprisingly to me, Angel
was the calmer of the two. Kasza had better</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>tests, but only because
hers were flashier. Angel was steady (mostly)</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and just did the movements.
She did reply to Kasza neighing at the trailer,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>but didn't stop to neigh,
just threw a few in to answer.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Oh, and Angel did bring
home ribbons. A 6th in our first class and a 4th in our second.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Pretty great for her first
show....</font></font></center>

No fuss or muss. She knows standing tied to the trailer from roading, and
many more horses and trailers around just gave her something to look at.
She did appreciate that we moved the hay over to her side when we'd take
Kasza away for her classes.</font></font></center>

if she'd lunge around me a couple of times at the walk I'd trust that she
was calm. Of course once she went around a couple of times I noticed people
watching, so I did throw in a couple of trot circles so they didn't think
I was silly for walking my horse in two circles....</font></font></center>
