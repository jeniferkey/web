<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Angel's back at the house to start getting
ready for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">fox hunting this fall. Her first lesson
back under tack went</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">great. She pulled toward the other horses
some, but settled</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in quickly and was very obedient. Chrissie
tried a few things</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and said that she seems quite willing
to learn. She bends,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">understands leg, and is a fairly uncomplicated
ride.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She was out at the kennels last Saturday
and let the hounds</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">lick her nose and was unconcerned when
we left her by the kennels</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and went riding off in the woods. This
weekend we'll see what</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">she thinks of going off in the woods herself.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think we're going to have fun.</font></center>
