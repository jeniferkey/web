<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Pooka lent out to
Brandon and his 'Mommy'</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(a note and pictures to show how Pooka
is doing)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Pooka's worth his weight in gold!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first Brandon did
not want to let go of Mommy.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But, having the saddle and the reins to
hold helped him feel a bit more in control.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once I got Brandon to sit up, I led the
pony a few steps and stopped.&nbsp; He looked at me and said "Go Mommy!"</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Before I knew it we were out in the arena
working on turning and stopping!&nbsp; After his ride, Brandon helped me
untack Pooka,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">as much as he could, gave him a treat,
and turned him out.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Needless to say, Brandon has ridden his
pony every day since! He couldn't wait for Daddy to get home so that</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">he could show Daddy how to stop, turn,
and make the pony go!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He helps me feed Pooka every day and helps
me catch him and lead him back to the barn after turnout.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Pooka is such a doll that when it is too
dark and we can't see him, he comes running!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And you've never seen anything as precious
as a three and a half year old child leading such a sweet darling pony!</font>
