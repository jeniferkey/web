<H3>INTJ -- The Scientist [Mastermind]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  Like the INFJ, the INTJ is out to describe the world.  But unlike the
INFJ, simply uncovering the facts is enough; it's not necessary to
convince others, since the INTJ is confident that the facts will speak
for themselves.
<P>
  In fact, self-confidence is a hallmark of the INTJ.  Looking toward
the future means accepting that what's done is done; INTJs deal with the
world as it is and rarely question their ability to do so.
<P>
  The Introverted iNtuitive types tend to be more concerned with
internal structures than with outer forms, and so it is with the
INTJ.  The Thinking-Judging preferences in general, operating on this
interest in internals, produce a personality type whose interest and
skill is in uncovering the hidden rules of the universe, using logic
(the T function) to bring order (the J function) to whatever is under
the microscope.
<P>
  This attention to objective detail usually leads INTJs to discount
authority.  If a rule or order makes sense to an INTJ, then it is
followed for its own merits.  "Because I said so" is never good enough
for the typical INTJ, making this type the ultimate pragmatist.
<P>
  Like INTPs, INTJs are concerned with the underlying structure of
things.  But unlike INTPs, once the typical INTJ feels the subject
is understood well enough to be productive, that's good enough.  Pure
logical consistency and systems design are left to the INTP; the INTJ
is better at basic analysis, rigorous proof, and the development of
systems that have clear applications.
<P>
  Energetic and creative, INTJs can sometimes come across as cold and
unyielding.  Their analytical skills are as easily applied to people as
to anything, with the result that others sometimes feel that the INTJ
has studied them like a bug and found them lacking.  Here, the high
self-confidence of the INTJ can become a disability, when they do not
make the effort to demonstrate the warmth they feel inside but don't
express.
