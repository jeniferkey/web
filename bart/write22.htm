<P>
  I've been known to advocate less government regulation and more personal authority and responsibility--not
  the other way 'round.
<P>
  The only way I can justify promoting this opinion, however, is if consumers have access to the information
  necessary to make informed purchasing decisions.  (As I said, "accurate, relevant, and complete.")  Therefore,
  as modern marketing seems intent on avoiding such necessary information in favor of glitzy entertainment, I
  criticize it.
<P>
  That does NOT mean I am calling for distant bureaucrats to regulate marketing.  It means that I expect you,
  me, and everyone else to determine what products are sold by taking the responsibility ourselves for
  insisting on good products truthfully advertised.  If a company does not provide what you want--including
  accurate information about their products--then don't give that company your money.  Companies which don't
  correctly satisfy informed consumers fail; companies which do meet real consumer desires succeed.  And that
  is just how it should be.
<P>
  In a free market, those who spend the money on goods and services are those who determine what goods and
  services are offered.  In a free market, if something you and others want is not being sold, you freely
  associate with others who think as you do and you encourage someone to create the product that doesn't
  exist.  And in a free market, the profit motive will encourage someone to provide that product.  The only
  marketing necessary is that which notes that the desired product is now available... which makes it less
  "marketing" than simple information.
<P>
  My bottom line is that the onus isn't on businesses to provide sound product information out of the
  goodness of their hearts, or on a government to coerce such behavior out of benevolence and wisdom--it's
  that the onus is on consumers to demand such information with their pocketbooks.  With power comes
  responsibility.
<P>
  <I> New things require marketing and because there are so many things around, it has to catch people's
  eyes. </I>
<P>
  Only if you accept as true the notion that individuals don't know what they want until/unless someone
  smarter than they are tells them.
<P>
  Yes, that does seem to be the way a lot of people (including many consumers) think these days.  But
  popularity has never made a wrong belief true.
<P>
  This seems to be a restatement of the old question: Does marketing spur demand, or does demand generate
  marketing?  My point is not that both processes don't occur (they do), but rather which process consumers
  ought to encourage as being more likely to yield desired products.  I advocate the latter process because
  it's "bottom-up"; it's driven by the consumers themselves (and therefore is more likely to accurately
  reflect what consumers actually want).  And I criticize the former process because it's top-down, driven
  by ad execs who are simply guessing what they think the great unwashed masses can be persuaded to buy.
<P>
  I know which process I think shows more respect toward individual citizens.
<P>
  <I> It's good that companies have to fight to keep their products selling.  If they didn't, they'd go
  down and we'd be left with a monopoly that had no incentive to produce new things - and we'd be back to
  plain cheese. </I>
<P>
  Yes and no.  Yes, competition is good; this is the force which drives businesses to improve their
  products, either through more and better functionality or through lower prices (or both).  Competition
  directs resources to where they are employed most efficiently.  The problem is that marketing is too
  often used as an way to avoid having to make real product improvements.  In other words, modern marketing
  is actually anti-competitive because it permits the inefficient redirection of resources.
<P>
  For example, instead of directing the maximum possible resources toward figuring out how to make their
  computer chips faster, Intel is now spending part of its income on commecials featuring people singing
  and dancing in brightly-colored bunny suits.  Please tell me, in precisely what way does this benefit
  the consumer?  How, exactly, does it make the product better, thus satisfying true consumer desires?
<P>
  How do either industry or consumers win when business resources get redirected to glitz and hype instead
  of to product improvement?
<P>
  By my lights, companies fail when they place <EM>too much</EM> faith in talking frogs and lip-syncing
  infants (etc., etc.).  Instead of dealing with market reality from the bottom up, they try to force it
  from the top down with expensive ad campaigns.  Such companies deserve to fail; by doing so they free up
  capital and employees for the creation and expansion of more market-responsive companies.  But defending
  marketing interrupts that reallocation of resources; it tells businesses, "Well, OK, you can go on being
  inefficient--as long as you entertain me, I don't care how bad your product really is."
<P>
  This does not seem wise to me.
<P>
  So please understand: When you say something like "If you take too much of this, it's bad for you, so
  the nanny state has decided to limit its sale," <EM>I am on your side</EM>.  I reject the idea that a
  few people in government are wise enough to decide for me how I may spend the income that I (not they)
  have labored to earn... but I also reject the idea that a few people in business are wise enough to
  decide for me what I want to buy with my wages.
<P>
  I don't approve of the nanny state, but neither do I approve of nanny businesses.  Neither mind-set
  respects individuals.
</P>
