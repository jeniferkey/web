AUGUST 24 (Thursday)   -- Oban to Kyle of Lochalsh
</H3>

<P>
The next day was Wedding Day.  Ann and I decided that we would get up early and do laundry, 
so we drove into Oban to try to locate a laundromat.  We found one, but since there weren't 
many machines and most of them were in use, when the time came that we had to be back at the 
hotel to change into our wedding clothes, we wound up having to take our wet clothes back with 
us.  (I never did find a dryer, and since I didn't think Jon [with whom I was sharing rooms] 
would appreciate my leaving socks, shorts and shirts draped across everything the entire time... 
well, let's just say it was an uncomfortable few days.)
<P>
But the wedding itself went off without a hitch.  Gin looked beautiful, Bill looked proud, 
everyone else looked happy, and I didn't drop the ring when the time came.  It was a wet, drizzly 
day outside, but inside the brightly-lit old church we were as snug as could be, while the 
minister's words echoed warmly around us.

<P>
Now that's how to have a wedding.
<P>
Afterwards, we sorted ourselves out back at the hotel, where Tricia scored many points in my 
book by making sure I got my share of little sandwiches and cold Cokes.  Then it was off on the 
road again for everyone but Bill and Gin, who would be enjoying an abbreviated honeymoon 
there in Connel.
<P>
One of the places I desperately wanted to see was scheduled for this part of the trip: the aptly-
named Glencoe: the Glen of Weeping.  A turnoff to the east from our northerly progress (which 
we missed the first time) led us to the Glencoe Visitor's Centre.  Here we saw a short video 
program that told the story of how the MacDonalds of Glencoe in the late 1600s had angered the 
Scottish ministers to the Dutch king of Scotland and England--a king who had supplanted the 
Scottish king by birth, James VII.  These MacDonalds of Glencoe were not without flaw (cattle 
theft being the most well-known of their vices), and they were cordially despised by their
neighbors, but the response to their support for the deposed Scottish monarch was to become a 
national scandal for its severity.
<P>
Late in 1691, the Master of Stair (Secretary of State and chief Scottish advisor to the new 
king, William III, earlier known as William, Prince of Orange) proposed that Jacobites be given 
"amnesty" by forcing them to sign an oath of loyalty to the new king.  Perhaps seeing a 
convenient way to eliminate a few enemies of the state, the king was convinced to require the 
signing of this bond by January 1 of the new year, and in only a few places.
<P>
As hoped, the MacDonalds of Glencoe were one of those clans that had trouble complying with this
order.  Never too enthusiastic about it to begin with, they arrived in Fort William just before 
the end of the year to sign... only to be told that they could not sign there; they would have to 
travel back south.  MacIan MacDonald of Glencoe signed on January 5, 1692, and thought that was 
the end of it.
<P>
In early February, government troops under the command of a Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon were 
quartered in the homes of the MacDonalds of Glencoe.  The MacDonalds took them in, showing them the 
open-handed hospitality which was a Highlander custom rarely refused even to one's enemies.  Twelve 
days into their stay, the government soldiers rose before dawn and repaid the courtesy of their 
hosts by--according to their orders from London--putting to the sword every soul they could find 
under seventy years of age.
<P>
There were some 150 men of the clan.  Captain Campbell and his 128 soldiers slaughtered 38 persons,
including two women and two children.  Most of the clan escaped to the snowy and inhospitable hills, 
where they endured for several months on the run.
<P>
This event may have been on the minds of the American Founding Fathers when they insisted on 
the Third Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the Bill of Rights: "No soldier shall, in time of 
peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a 
manner to be prescribed by law."  Few in America today may remember why such a law was 
deemed so important, but in Glen Coe I saw Scottish faces grim with a 300-year-old memory of 
injustice.
<P>
After we left the Visitor's Centre (where I managed to find another book store), we drove 
through the hills of Glen Coe.  This was, for me, one of the most heart-stoppingly beautiful 
places of the entire trip.  As dramatic as Mull had been in its openness, so Glen Coe was in its 
misty mystery.  Ridges like green spikes shot up without warning, their peaks disappearing into 
the low gray fog that lay over the land like a shroud.  They say that it is always so in the Glen of 
Weeping, and I believe them.
</P>

<P>
Finally we shook ourselves free of the glamour of the place and piled back into our cars to find 
our road north again.  Tricia and I were sharing a car at this point, which let us get to know one 
another better--one of the really enjoyable moments of the trip for me.  And then, having passed 
Eilean Donan Castle (probably the most-photographed castle in all of Scotland), we reached our 
hotel at Kyle of Lochalsh.
<P>
The Lochalsh Hotel is one of those seaside hotels with great charm.  Though large and somewhat 
expensive, it repays you with lovely vistas and all the cool, fresh ocean air you can draw into your 
lungs.  As you look out your bedroom window across the narrow channel to Skye, seagulls will catch 
crackers tossed into the air.
<P>
That night found us all at what must have been the hotspot for all nearby night life--the local 
dining establishment.  It was crowded and noisy and hot, and everyone in the place seemed to be 
having a rollicking good time.  After several hours of this, we stumbled through the darkness 
back to our hotel by the water.
<P>
Later on that night we all sat together downstairs in the lobby, where some of us insisted on 
sampling various odd and unpalatable things from the nearby bar.  Beth brought out a deck of 
cards, so Tricia went to work on several games of Solitaire which she kept losing.  All of us 
except Tricia thought it was pretty funny when we realized that she was playing with one-half of 
a merged Canasta deck.  (Having duplicates of some cards while others were missing completely 
would have made it pretty difficult for anyone to win a game of Solitaire.)
<P>
When the billiard table proved to be equally unworkable, we retired for the night.
