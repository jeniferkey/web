<P>
  I talk about (and agree with) your overall point--that completely doing away with the IRS is a fantasy.  It
  can't work and it won't happen.  (That is, unless the rest of the government goes with it... in which case
  we'll be dealing with bigger problems than overbearing tax collectors. *grin*)
<P>
  As for specifics:
<P>
  <I> There has been some suggestion of a consumption tax, since we already have a sales tax.  But it means you
  will need to have more government involvement in enforcement of its collection, since some businesses currently
  have a "cash" business that sales tax never gets paid on. </I>
<P>
  I concur with that analysis.  From an "individual citizen" viewpoint, I'm best off with a sales tax because
  my personal finances become off-limits to government snooping.  (That's the claim, anyway; I have a feeling
  it wouldn't be allowed to happen this way in practice.)  But even if true, private citizens still depend on
  the efficient activity of businesses for their economic well-being.  Too many businesses crushed under the
  weight of a tax code shifted to corporate taxation, and jobs will be lost--with a direct impact on those
  "individual citizens."
<P>
  The question is, just how massive would be a tax code based on collecting sales taxes?  Too complex, and all
  we do is move the current problem around a bit--"rearranging deck chairs on the <I>Titanic</I>," as the phrase
  goes.  And, as you correctly note, there will be that little problem of cash transactions.  How could a
  government tax those, short of requiring government approval every time we go to the automatic teller?
<P>
  Until I start hearing answers to these questions from those who favor this approach (such as Rep. Bill
  Archer), I don't think I can support it.
<P>
  But:
<P>
  <I> Another disadvantage is that a consumption tax is regressive when compared to income, so you'd need
  some means to compensate the low-income for their high tax rate. </I>
<P>
  This, I don't agree with quite as wholeheartedly.
<P>
  Most importantly, it's not as significant a problem as that of cash transactions.  We can quibble as to
  specifics, but reasonable exemptions for food and housing--while forcing a higher sales tax rate--would
  essentially answer this objection.
<P>
  That said, I don't know if I really consider it "regressive," or that a flat, non-exempted sales tax would
  constitute a "high" rate of taxation on lower-income households.
<P>
  Say the sales tax is ten percent, with no exemptions.  I have $10,000 to spend, and I spend $2,000 on
  groceries, so my tax is $200, or 2 percent of my income.  Now you, on the other hand, have $1,000,000 to
  spend.  You also spend $2,000 on groceries, and are thus also taxed for $200.  But for you, this amounts
  to 0.02 percent of your income.
<P>
  On this basis, it's possible to claim that a flat, non-exempted sales tax is "regressive," or in other
  words that it's effectively a higher tax rate on lower-income households.
<P>
  The problem with this analysis is that someone with an income of $1,000,000 is not going to spend just
  $2,000 on groceries.  What's more, such households will buy things other than groceries.  (This ability of
  higher-income households to buy more things than low-income households may strike you as unfair... but that
  is a question totally unrelated to tax rates.)
<P>
  Those with higher incomes tend to spend more money (on an absolute basis) than those with lower
  incomes.  Therefore they would wind up paying more (on an absolute basis) in taxes in a sales tax
  regime.  Thus, the true effective tax rate is not measured accurately by picking one kind of expenditure
  (or even a "market basket," as is currently used in calculating the Consumer Price Index); the true
  effective tax rate is calculated by summing up <EM>all</EM> taxes collected on consumption versus income.
<P>
  On that basis, I would expect to find that both "low" and "high" income households would wind up paying
  very nearly the same percentages of their incomes in taxes.
<P>
  But of course that's an economic philosophy argument.  It has nothing to do with the political reality
  that Democrats would never vote for a flat tax that didn't have exemptions for (at the very least) food
  and housing.
<P>
  Overall, though, I think you're right that dreams of "Life Without the IRS" are just that.
