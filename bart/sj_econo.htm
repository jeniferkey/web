<H2>Overview</H2>

<BR>
<P>
Economics is more than the study of money.  It is intimately bound up
in technology and politics and human nature itself.
<P>
At its heart, economics is about the satisfaction of human desires.  At
its lowest levels, that means daily subsistence for oneself; it means
the movement of technology for survival.  But as the wealth of clusters
of individuals increases, economics begins to mean the satisfaction of
ever more abstract desires.  Finally, when group wealth has reached the
point that even most abstract desires are being met, the focus of
economics shifts from the individual to ordering the desires of others.
<P>
This segment will study economics from that perspective, with a special
emphasis on what happens when--always for the noblest of
reasons--individuals are treated as incompetent to make their own
economic decisions.

Let's start with a review of the economic effects of the various kinds
of political systems enjoyed throughout human history. This handy chart
has appeared on the Web in many places; this is my modified version of it.

<BR>
<H3>Capitalism, or, The Trouble with Karl</H3>
<BR>
<P>
The trouble with Karl Marx is that he was partly right.  In his works
with Engels--primarily <I>Capital</I> and <I>The Communist
Manifesto</I>--Marx accurately described some of the economic ills of
his age.  The problem is that it's easy to conclude that, if his
diagnosis of economic inequality was accurate, then his prescription
for curing that problem must be accurate, too... but that's not so.
<P>
Marx's "solution" to what he perceived to be the imperfection of
economic inequality followed directly from his utopian vision, his
impatience and his arrogance.  Like most liberal conceptions of human
nature, Marx's dialectic presumes not only that "fairness" is a
necessary social good, but that it can be mandated by the enlightened
for immediate application, rather than being a product of voluntary
behavior that must be encouraged (by example) in individuals over
time.  This early manifestation of liberal impatience with human
imperfection thus called for the quick imposition of economic fairness
by an elite.
<P>
The concept of "ownership" was held to be merely a primitive belief
system that would be replaced by the more modern theory of economic
equality, as taught by those whose refined sensibilities could appreciate
its moral superiority.  The bourgeoisie would complain at being
dispossessed, but their clinging to the outdated and immoral dogma of
"ownership" just proved that they needed someone to decide for them their
needs and abilities.  With the liquidation of the middle class and the
suppression of subversive intellectuals, the proletariat would become
the only class, thus eliminating all class distinctions and producing
perfect fairness.
<P>
But this ignored the question of how to insure that those elite were
themselves capable and willing to apply perfect fairness to everyone,
and brushed aside the question of whether perfect fairness and humanity
could coexist.  The failure of Marx's presumptions--and of those who
have chosen not to question those presumptions--made his prescription
for improving the human species wrong.  And it made implementing that
prescription muderously evil.
<P>
The trouble is, although Marx's prescription was wrong, his description
of the unequal distribution of wealth in his day was accurate.  (Just
as Adam Smith's description of the evils of unrestricted mercantilism
was accurate.)  In fact, Marx was right to object to the means of
production being held solely by a few wealthy individuals.  Those who
labor ought to control some of the capital they create; this provides
incentive to take care of the capital created, and to create more of
it.  This is the function of the concept of ownership.
<P>
But Marx and Engels rejected this self-interested aspect of human
nature as unenlightened.  Rather than trust individuals to decide for
themselves the best employment of the the capital they help create--as
guided by the moral institutions Adam Smith insisted were necessary if
capitalism were to promote the common good--the liberal impulse is to
distrust individual enterprise.  In the utopian vision, the mere
creation of capital is not a sufficient cause for owning that
capital.  Being able to create capital is not proof of ability or
willingness to "fairly" employ that capital.  Thus Marx and Engels
concluded that all capital should be nationalized, to be controlled by
the socialist state until the people became capable of perfect
selflessness.  At that point (so the theory went) the state would
wither away and perfect communism--perfect fairness--would thrive.
<P>
As the essay on communism shows, that theory was spectacularly wrong.
<P>
Capitalism, on the other hand, came up with private investment in public
corporations as a means by which to transfer the control of capital from
a few individual owners to many smaller part-owners.  It had the effect
that Marx claimed to desire in that individual ownership of capital
tends to be more evenly distributed when individuals are confident that
they will be able to benefit from that ownership.  As more people try to
create and acquire capital, everyone's lot improves.  But this is
achieved only by recognizing the reality of human nature, of the
self-interested desire of real, individual human beings to improve their
material conditions.  Like a judo expert, capitalism works with the
human desire for material security instead of fighting it.  By strongly
defending the principle that capital, as a form of property, can be
owned, individuals are reassured that their labor will be rewarded in
the material terms that they desire.  In this way, capitalism offers
individuals an incentive to labor voluntarily that other economic
systems cannot match.
<P>
Capitalism has a couple of great advantages over other systems.  By far
the most important is the fact that an individual will work much harder
for himself and his family than he will for some distant bureaucrat or
commissar.  To put it another way, voluntary labor is more productive
over the long run than involuntary labor.
<P>
But more than doing the same things better, capitalism does what other
systems cannot: it encourages the voluntary cooperation which leads to
the creation of capital that can't be generated otherwise.  While some
forms of capital may be created by an individual person, many more forms
require the cooperative efforts of two or more persons.  Capitalism's
unique focus on upholding the individual's right to voluntary employ his
capital as he sees fit tends to encourage more cooperative effort than
other systems which assume that individuals cannot adequately decide for
themselves what's in their best economic interests.
<P>
Capitalism thus produces public good--that is, products and services 
that improve the lives of everyone--even though the specific employment
of capital isn't directed by one all-controlling state authority.  Each
individual owner of capital may be looking out only for his own good,
but he is the person best fit to do so.  After all, it's his capital
that's on the line.  If he uses it poorly, he becomes poorer--that's an
incentive to wisdom no distant bureaucrat or central planner or academic
theorist can hope to match.
<P>
An individual's voluntary cooperation with others to increase their
mutual capital helps to create an environment where every owner of
capital knows that cooperation is both possible and profitable.  And
this environment of trust leads not only to the generation of more
capital than any other system can produce, it directs that capital to
where it does the most good for the most people.
<P>
It is as though an "invisible hand" were at work... just as Adam Smith
said.  To paraphrase Winston Churchill's famous evaluation of democracy:
Capitalism is without question a flawed economic system... but it's
better than any other system we've thought of so far.

Hazlitt, Henry -- <I>Economics in One Lesson</I>, Crown, 1979.  The best introduction to economic reason.  Clearly
and intelligently written, this book manages in its few pages to demonstrate the simple errors at the heart of so
much economic mythology.  (The chapter on the "minimum wage" ought to be required reading for all taxpayers; it is a
case study in repudiating the single worst political problem of our time: impatience.)
<P>
Muller, Jerry Z. -- <I>Adam Smith in His Time and Ours: Designing the Decent Society</I>, Free Press, 1993.  A
long-needed look at Smith's great achievement as a work of social philosophy, rather than as pure economic
analysis.  Muller successfully shows how Smith, even 200 years ago, argued not for unrestrained capitalism
<I>&uuml;ber alles</I>, but for what we would recognize as an active middle way between modern liberalism,
conservatism and libertarianism, directed at achieving the maximum freedom of individuals at the minimum expense to
a good and moral society.
<P>
Smith, Adam -- <I>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</I>, Liberty Fund, 1982.  The often forgotten other side of Smith's
purpose in advocating capitalism, this book was based on his lectures as Chair of Moral Philosophy at the University
of Glasgow.
<P>
Tilly, Charles -- <I>Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1992</I>, Blackwell, 1993.  An interesting
modern study of the formation, maturation, and dissolution of European nations, as seen in the dual contexts of
economic and political change.
<P>
Von Mises, Ludwig -- <I>Human Action: A Treatise on Economics</I>, Laissez Faire Books, 1966.  The <I>magnum opus</I>
of Mises, this work encompassed his broad conception of "economics" as expressed choices of human behavior, based on
assigning value to alternatives.  From this, Mises produced a model underlying what we separate as economics,
psychology, sociology, and politics.
