  I still can't read Hemingway or Faulkner or Fitzgerald or Steinbeck or any
of those guys. Literature courses tend to be taught by second-rate writers who
insist that nothing means what it says, that every paragraph, every sentence,
every word, has some deep hidden meaning that must be ferreted out, otherwise
you don't <EM>really</EM> understand what the author was saying. (Note that
this helps second-rate writers avoid having to do real work.)
<P>
  There's even a crowd these days who take this approach to its extreme,
claiming that no writing has any meaning at all. According to the
"deconstuctionists," when you look closely enough at anything, all meaning
breaks down into absurdity and existentialism. (Note that this helps avoid
having to work at being even a second-rate writer.)
<P>
  Eventually I caught on that all this stuff is baloney. Most writers in human
history have had a single basic meaning behind their work: "Someone will pay me
for this." The fact that we now have technical names for seeing too much or too
little meaning in writing just makes it baloney with a hifalutin name to awe
the peasants. Either way, the realization comes too late for me. My tastes are
set, and they tend not to include "literature."
<P>
  One thing I did come away with, however, is a powerful disrespect for the
"Lit. Crit." set. I've read some literary criticism that actually does
illuminate an author's mind and intent. But this rare form is additive
criticism. It doesn't reduce words to meaninglessness in order to demonstrate
the critic's superiority; it clarifies the meaning of a writer's words by
placing them in a useful context.
<P>
  By far the more common variety of plant in the Garden of Knowledge is the
deconstructive weed. Here's an example of one such pest.

  A Critical Review of 'He Sat on a Rock' by Bart Stewart"

  These are the times that try men's souls, yes, and the souls of women and
persons of color and otherly-gendered persons as well, because this reviewer is
no Thomas Paine. Who is this Bart Stewart, who so heedless of the gods of the
copybook headings mocks us? What Titan is he, to take incandescent pen in hand
to rebuke the mighty Olympus Corporation and its international subsidiaries and
shareholders?
<P>
  For our answers--as best as feeble intellects can grasp them--let us turn to
the words of the Master himself.
<P>
  "He sat on a rock." What does the author mean by this? What does the rock
symbolize? A rock is a hard, unyielding object; obviously it represents the
difficult situations in which we all find ourselves. But a rock may also be
used as a tool. The fact that we can use it to sit upon, to employ it in the
purpose of taking our ease, is a clear analog to humanity's technological
prowess in the service of leisure. (<I>Facilis descensus Averni!</I>) Thus we see
that the rock stands for both the opportunities and the challenges faced by
every individual, whose use of objects may in time become a dependence on
them. And in a final fillip of subtlety, the author chooses a rock not only
to indicate technology in general, but energy technology specifically--the
Greek word for rock, <I>petra</I>, the word given by the Christian world's
"savior" in naming his first bishop Peter, is also the base for our
modern-day savior, "petroleum."
<P>
  "He fell off." Aha! Here the author strikes us in the face, crying "Wake
up, fool! Do you not see the terrible danger of nuclear annihilation inherent
in your blind snuffling for the nipple of cheap energy from your Mother
Earth?" The "fall" is reminiscent of that quondam angel and would-be savior
Lucifer, whose name itself ("lightbearer") symbolizes the blinding flash of
the atomic genie let loose from his magnetic bottle. Are we not all slowly
slipping from our collective rock?
<P>
  "The End." And here we find the fundament of this brilliant work of
minimalist fiction. (Though this reviewer hesitates to impugn such a noble
work with the appellation of mere "fiction.") The author deftly ridicules
modern bourgois society, with its anal fixation on the "movement" and
"processing" of consumable resources into waste, sure harbinger of
self-inflicted social strangulation. Yet he offers us hope, too, in the
<I>Wertfreiheit</I> suggestion that, by not making "asses" of ourselves, we can
escape the doom that seems to beckon to us, siren-like, from Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl.
<P>
  This reviewer will not sleep tonight. But whether Morpheus flees from a soul
tried by the tramping of high-energy gamma radiation through mortal flesh, or
from radiant joy at discovering another soul with social acuity to equal this
reviewer's, ah! Who can say?
</P>
  <HR>
<P>
  And there you are. This is what passes for enlightened comprehension these days.
<P>
  Welcome to the world of postmodernism, in which the goal is not the expansion
of understanding but the imposition of pseudointellectual authority.  In other
words, "I understand this stuff and you don't, so get down on your knees and
thank me for acknowledging your existence, you miserable little white-bread,
middle-class, homophobic, <I>bourgeois</I> trolls."
<P>
  And the elite wonder why sensible people ignore them....
