<H3>ESFJ -- The Giver [Provider]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  "Public service" is the hallmark of the ESFJ.  Naturally sociable,
ESFJs tend to gravitate toward careers in sales and local politics,
where they can interact usefully with as many persons as possible.
<P>
  For the ESFJ, life is about people.  Mixing, mingling, and helping
when- and wherever possible are the lifeblood of the ESFJ, who is
happiest when being useful to large numbers of people.  ESFJs can be
counted on to remember anniversaries, and enjoy celebrating events
with family and friends, where they will make sure that plenty of
good food and drink are available.
<P>
  ESFJs can usually be found in business positions which let them
be of value to others, but they also make time to volunteer in their
communities.  This interest in public service is part of a keen desire
to actively maintain social standards.  All of the Sensing-Judging types
are concerned with preserving traditional standards; the ESFJ expresses
this concern in the form of "shoulds" and "should nots."  At work, at
home, in schools and in civic groups, ESFJs have lists of rules which
they believe should be followed.  And because most ESFJs tend to be
respectful, loyal, friendly, outgoing and genuinely considerate, other
types find themselves (sometimes to their surprise) willing to try to
make the ESFJ happy.
<P>
  Where ESFJs can run into trouble is when they feel their efforts are
not appreciated.  Over the short term, they become unhappy, but continue
to try to serve others even if it means overwork.  In time, though, an
ESFJ will eventually "snap," taking out his or her frustrations on
anyone in the vicinity.  This can also happen as a result of ESFJs
taking blame on themselves for problems they didn't cause and can't
solve.  At such time, ESFJs can become pessimistic and gloomy, certain
that disaster is about to strike.
<P>
  This tendency to consider the worst alternatives makes ESFJs the
natural preservers of the good things in life.  Their concern for how
bad things can get ensures that they will always have a little something
saved up when life--as it inevitably does--takes a turn for the
worse.  It may never get as bad as the ESFJ fears, but if does, he or
she will be ready.
