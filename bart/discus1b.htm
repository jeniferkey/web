<CAPTION><B>II. ACCEPTABILITY CRITERION</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
  The Acceptability Criterion is the expectation that the assertions of an
  argument will be acceptable to a reasonable person.  Examples of acceptable
  assertions are: personal knowledge of facts or events; a body of independent,
  peer-reviewed research; adequately-defended claims in the same argument; and
  conclusions of other good arguments.  Examples of unacceptable assertions
  are: claims that contradict other claims accepted, defended, or known to be
  true; claims indistinguishable from or as questionable as the argument's
  conclusion; claims based on usually unstated assumptions which are highly
  questionable; and claims which contradict themselves, are linguistically
  confusing, or which otherwise are not understandable.

<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER><P><B>A. Fallacies of Linguistic Confusion</B></P></CENTER>
  Fallacies of linguistic confusion are errors of words and logic which
  prevent the formulation of a clear, understandable assertion.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="50%">
<B>1. Equivocation</B>
<P>(Using a word with two distinctly different meanings as though it had
the same meaning throughout the argument)</P>

     getting into arguments."</P>

correctly understand an assertion)</P>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>3. Improper Accent</B>
<P>(Distorting the meaning of an assertion by
stating only part of it, either through stressing only part of a true
statement, or by taking a statement out of its original context)</P>

<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER><P><B>B. Begging-the-question Fallacies</B></P></CENTER>
  Fallacies which are said to "beg the question" are those which ask the
  listener to accept the truth of the overall question as expressed in one
  assertion.

<B>1. Arguing in a Circle</B>
<P>(Assertion which is asserted as a conclusion)</P>

   <P>"But now let's consider the ridiculous notion that Y might be true."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>3. Loaded or Complex Question</B>
<P>(Assertion in which an unstated
premise is assumed true and thus already "loaded" into the stated
assertion, or which forces a simple response to a question for which a
simple response is inadequate)</P>

      defend Europe."</P>

reality)</P>

   <P>"America is the only remaining superpower; no one is going to
     challenge us, so we should drastically reduce defense spending."</P>

<P>(Allowing for no exceptions to
the letter of a principle, or denying a principle because of some
exceptions)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"Our policy is that no one under 18 will be admitted, therefore you
     can't bring your infant child into the theater."</P>

     government."</P>

     things with feathers."</P>

     thing alters the behavior of the thing being observed.  So all
     opinion polls are worthless."</P>
   <P>"Variety in life is a good thing.  But being married to only one
     person offers no variety.  So marriage must be a bad thing."</P>
</TD>
