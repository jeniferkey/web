<H3>Overview</H3>

<BR>
<P>
"Work."  Is that a good word or a bad word?
<P>
Taken in a general sense, I think it's a pretty good word.  Where would
we be without work?  In a personal sense, however, matters aren't quite
so clear.
<P>
As it happens, I enjoy what I do.  I was lucky enough to have a family
who helped me gain the opportunity to find out what I wanted to do to
earn my daily bread.  And I was equally lucky to stumble onto a field
for which I not only have some talent but which feels completely natural
to me, as though I was born to it.
<P>
Even so, it's work.  It's a job.  No matter how much I like the work
itself, there are always other things that must be dealt with in order
to get the work done.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>My Views</H3>

<BR>
<P>
As I see it, there are four separate but related aspects to doing a
job.  Specifically, they are: the Application (what the labor is
intended to produce), the Skill (the general professional ability
applied), the Tools (those devices and processes whose use is required),
and Administration (those external requirements which must be satisfied
in order to do the actual job).
<P>
The table below summarizes three examples of labor decomposed into the
four aspects:

<P>
Work, then, is not merely activity--it's activity for a purpose.  Those
who work are only rewarded if their labor adds value.  But how do you
measure value?  Yes, eventually the market will decide... but markets
are large-scale processes; they can't tell you precisely how much to pay
this or that worker in particular.
<P>
That's where the four aspects of a job come into play.  By splitting up
and categorizing the parts of a job, by definining what it is that a
"job" entails, it becomes possible to measure performance.  This allows
an employer to compare one individual's effort against another in the
same functional area, and by doing so arrive at a reasonable rate of
compensation--a function of "value."
<P>
None of this is particularly new thinking, I'm sure.  A trained
economist (as opposed to a curious amateur like myself) could probably
provide scholarly references and commentary on the constitution of
"value."  What I'm not sure has been proposed before is the particular
division of the functional aspects of labor shown in the table above.
<P>
So I thought, "What the heck."
