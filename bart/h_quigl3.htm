<H2>The Seven Stages of Civilization</H2>

<P>
Quigley's analysis (using his six features) led him to conclude that
civilizations tend to emerge, grow, decline, and fall in a specific and
observable sequence of stages:
</P>

<OL>
<LI><B>Mixture</B></LI>
<LI><B>Gestation</B></LI>
<LI><B>Expansion</B></LI>
<LI><B>Age of Conflict</B></LI>
<LI><B>Universal Empire</B></LI>
<LI><B>Decay</B></LI>
<LI><B>Invasion</B></LI>
</OL>

<BR>
<H3>The Seven Stages in Detail</H3>

<BR>
<H4>1. Mixture</H4>

<P>
Civilizations are born at the intersections of societies. Where rules
and customs are understood, as in the core of a social region, the
members of that society have no incentive to change; in fact, social
pressure tends to prevent change.
<P>
Where differing cultures intersect at their peripheries, however, it is
not so clear what rules should be followed. For example, when the
marriage customs of two societies differ, and intermarriage begins to
become widespread, how will it be decided which customs to respect and
which to reject?
<P>
In this case and others, it may be that new customs will be invented so
as to satisfy that need without offending families. When this process
has become broad enough and lasted long enough for those practicing
these new customs to appear distinct from their original neighboring
societies, we say that a new society has formed. Out of the mixture of
cultures has come a new culture, with the opportunity to become a
civilization.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>2. Gestation</H4>

<P>
The period of gestation (that is, a time of development in preparation
for later independent growth) is defined not by what it is, but rather
by what it isn't: it isn't mixture or expansion.
<P>
Accordingly, this can be a relatively short period of time, or it may
last for hundreds of years. It is a time of waiting for two conditions
to come into being. First, the new society must mot be swallowed up by a
neighboring society. Proximity to a stronger and expansionistic neighbor
will prevent a new civilization from forming.
<P>
Second, the incipient civilization must develop an instrument of
expansion. Without such an instrument, a society cannot gain the
critical mass required for its members to begin conceiving of themselves
as having a unique identity--that is, as a civilization. This stage is
the time during which various instruments may be developed and discarded
until one gains wide acceptance.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>3. Expansion</H4>

<P>
Once a civilization has a functioning instrument of expansion, it will
begin to grow. This growth may be identified in four particular areas:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>production of goods</LI>
  <LI>increase in population</LI>
  <LI>increase in geographic extent</LI>
  <LI>increase in knowledge</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This period of growth is often explosive, because each of these four
kinds of growth both depends on and augments the others. An expanding
civilization will begin to enjoy an increased standard of living as its
level of knowledge and production of goods rise. That knowledge includes
medical understanding and technology, so life expectancy increases. The
growth in population increases production, while leaving more persons
free to explore the periphery of the civilization, expanding its
borders. This exploration adds not only to the size of the civilization,
but also to its knowledge. Exploration also opens up access to
additional and new natural resources, which in turn contribute to
increased production of goods.
<P>
An important feature of this period is the development of a core area
within the civilization. As geographic expansion continues, the
transmission of culture from the central area in which that culture is
strongest to the expanding fringe areas becomes more difficult. This
tends to split a civilization (particularly toward the end of the period
of expansion) into what can be regarded as a core area and a periphery,
usually defined by geography.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>4. Age of Conflict</H4>

<P>
As noted earlier, eventually all instruments become institutions. Once
this process has occurred to a substantial degree to a civilization's
instrument of expansion, the civilization enters an age of conflict.
<P>
This period is marked by four trends:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>a decline in the rate of expansion</LI>
  <LI>an increase in class conflicts, especially in the core</LI>
  <LI>an increase in imperialistic wars</LI>
  <LI>an increase in irrationality and general pessimism</LI>
</UL>

<P>
As the instrument of expansion becomes an institution in order to
preserve the privileges of the elite, the civilization--particularly in
the core--becomes more static, bureaucratized and legalistic. This tends
to punish innovation instead of rewarding it, and progress in the
accumulation of surplus is slowed as a result of the decline in
inventiveness.
<P>
This does not go unnoticed by a civilization's members. Although it is
a decline in the <EM>rate</EM> of expansion, not an actual decline in
expansion (that is, a contraction), an advanced civilization is so
accustomed to expansion that it cannot <EM>not</EM> expand. To put it
another way, survival requires accelerating growth, and once such growth
has begun, it must continue. (This is one of the primary criticisms
against "progress" from both the environmentalist Left and the
culturalist Right. Both have a point, but both also fail to realize
that the only real-world alternative is no civilization at all.)
<P>
The declining rate of expansion pits the entrenched elite against the
great mass of the people. When resources are perceived as being limited,
competition between classes ensues. "The rich" hang on to their wealth
and prerogatives, but, realizing that they are in the minority, divert
the attention of the increasingly resentful masses with entertainment,
and appease them with token gestures of wealth redistribution.
<P>
Meanwhile, resentment at not enjoying the same increase in the standard
of living as their parents leads the masses to feel insecure, and this
feeling manifests as social disruption and other irrational behavior. As
Quigley describes it: "This is generally a period of gambling, use of
narcotics or intoxicants, obsession with sex (frequently as perversion),
increasing crime, growing numbers of neurotics and psychotics, growing
obsession with death and with the Hereafter."
<P>
Most prominently, wars of imperialism begin. These are attempts to
impose a single political structure on the entire civilization, to
achieve economic expansion by political means. These conflicts usually
occur from the outside in. That is, wars of imperialism are generally
waged by the political entities on the periphery of a civilization
against the core. As the core succumbs first to a declining rate of
expansion, and as unrest peaks there first, the more dynamic peripheral
states conclude (not unreasonably, from their perspective) that "the
center is hollow, it cannot stand." Rather than expanding outward, the
smaller boundary states first consume each other, then they turn their
attention inward, fighting over the remains of the core until one state
(usually one of the most peripheral) has imposed its political structure
over the entire civilization.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>5. Universal Empire</H4>

<P>
As previously noted, once an instrument of expansion has become an
institution, one of three things will happen: it will be reformed
back into a functioning instrument; it will be circumvented by the
creation of a new instrument (which permits expansion while leaving the
trappings of power to those who controlled the previous institution); or
those with vested interests in preserving the institution of expansion
will prevail, and it will become permanently entrenched.
<P>
In the former two cases, in which there is a new instrument of
expansion, the civilization returns to Stage 3, the age of Expansion.
Otherwise, it proceeds to Stage 5: Universal Empire.
</P>

<HR>

<H5>A Special Note about Choice</H5>

<P>
This, not incidentally, is the aspect of Quigley's concept of
civilizational development that truly sets him apart from Spengler. In
contrast to Spengler's deterministic view, in which a civilization is
doomed from the moment it comes into being, Quigley asserts that any
civilization can survive indefinitely, just as long as it keeps
reforming or circumventing its institutionalized instruments of
expansion.
<P>
Members of civilizations, Quigley says, have a choice. If they act in
one way, they return to expansion; if they voluntarily choose another
way, they step onto the road that leads to empire and extinction. This
non-deterministic "if-then-else" structure seems intuitive to, say, a
computer programmer, but it is a remarkable insight for a historian,
scientist or no, to perceive in a long-duration human organization such
as a civilization.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
This process of reform, circumvention, or vested interest success takes
place during the wars of imperialism in Stage 4, the Age of Conflict.
Once a single peripheral state has imposed its political structure over
the whole civilization, a universal empire has been achieved. With the
cessation of hostilities, an apparent Golden Age ensues.
<P>
This is later regarded as a time of peace and prosperity. There is peace
because there are no more political opponents. And there is prosperity
derived from relaxing internal trade barriers, instituting common
systems of measurement and coinage, and increasing domestic government
spending to maintain what is felt should be the proper appearance of a
universal empire.
<P>
But these things prove illusory. The peace is the calm of exhaustion,
and the prosperity is the burning of internal resources to maintain a
standard of living that cannot long be supported. Without an instrument
of expansion, there is little if any innovation to replace the wealth
being spent on unproductive consumption and gigantic monuments (such as
the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and the Colosseum).
<P>
In Quigley's memorable phrase: "The golden age is really the glow of
overripeness, and soon decline begins."
</P>

<BR>
<H4>6. Decay</H4>

<P>
Once it becomes clear that the bulk of a civilization's wealth has been
used up, the decline is usually mercifully swift. "Mercifully," because
this is a period of great distress.
<P>
During this time, as recognition of the civilization's poverty spreads,
the standard of living falls quickly. Law and order break down. Civil
unrest sparks protests, some of which turn violent. Taxes cannot be
collected, and other forms of public service such as military service
(and military actions themselves) are resisted. Property cannot be
protected except (if at all) by force. Personal violence becomes a
daily occurrence. Trade fails, as fraud can no longer be punished.
Town life fails; basic survival needs force people into the country
where they can grow food, and the "middle class" disappears. Religious
revivals sweep the land. The medical technology that sustains life
becomes difficult or impossible to obtain, resulting in high rates of
infant mortality and shortened lifespans. Finally, literacy itself
fails.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>7. Invasion</H4>

<P>
Although geographical or other features may allow a civilization to
remain in a period of decay for many years, eventually it falls prey to
forces of one or more external cultures. Whether by military occupation
or political annexation, or simply by incorporation through settlement,
invasion at some point destroys what was once a civilization. The
mixture of old and new cultures may produce a new culture, forming Stage
1 of what will become a new civilization, or it may not. But the old
civilization is gone.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>TABLE OF CIVILIZATIONS THROUGH STAGES</H4>

<P>
We are now in a position to see a table showing the progress through the
seven stages for five civilizations. Like the chart in the section on
Oswald <A HREF="h_spengl.htm">Spengler</A>, this table identifies stages
in a civilization's existence, and relates those stages to rough ranges
of dates.
<P>
But Quigley's theory of history differs from Spengler's in that the
former is not deterministic (that is, that that civilizations emerge,
grow, decline, and fall in that order and with no hope of variation).
So Quigley's chart differs as well, demonstrating that there can be
multiple periods of expansion, conflict and empire, just as long as
instruments become institutions and then are reformed or circumvented.
<P>
Thus, Quigley's chart of stages is slightly more complex than that for
Spengler. Just remember to think of multiple dates in terms of the
processes of institutionalization (moving downward in the table), and
reform and circumvention of institutions (moving back upward in the
table).
<P>
Note: I have modified Quigley's table slightly to reflect the collapse
of the Soviet Union (which I date in 1989) as indicative of the
institutionalization of the Russian civilization's most recent
instrument of expansion, socialism. This places that civilization in a
new age of conflict, whose outcome is yet to be determined.
