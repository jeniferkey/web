<P>
  <I> I don't know what this apparent sex-based difference means, or even if it has a meaning. </I>
<P>
  You offered several possible reasons.  Some fit within a theory I have, and some don't (and are therefore "questionable" *grin*).
<P>
  The ones I'm not too sure about are those which describe as merely environmental the apparent difference in how the average
man and the average woman deal with technical issues.  For example:
<P>
  <I> there are still more male computer geeks than female </I>
<P>
  <I> 1)  The head of tech support is likely to be male & perceive men as more technically competent </I>
<P>
  <I> 2)  History -- 20 or 30 years ago, there were even fewer women in the computer field, so the older geeks who are still
around are male and the managers are mostly male </I>
<P>
  I have a tough time going with possibilities that appear to rely on claims of "oppression" by "the good ol' boys club."  I
realize you didn't make such claims directly, but they do seem implicit in your observations.  To paraphrase them, "Men gained
power early and, due to their perceptions of women as inferior, deliberately prevented women from gaining a share of that power."
<P>
  The problem with this view is two-fold (at least).  First, technical competence derives from persistence in understanding
machines.  With information and computers as ubiquitous as they are, there is no male power structure that can prevent a
curious and motivated woman from becoming as technically competent as she likes.  Oppression just doesn't factor into this.
<P>
  Second, and speaking more specifically about the tech support field, there is a counter-argument to the "men trust only
other men for technical information" argument.  Namely, tech support isn't just a technical job; it's also a service job--it
involves communication with other people... and there is evidence that many people prefer to be helped by women rather than
men, perhaps out of the belief that a woman won't lie to them and rip them off, or become impatient and condescending.
<P>
  Between these two counter-arguments, I honestly do have real trouble accepting the "environmental" argument.
<P>
  On the other hand, you did provide a couple of possibilities that seem to me to have promise:
<P>
  <I> the more "technical" it gets (operating system support vs. applications support; network support vs. computer training,
etc.), the more likely the support person is to be male. </I>
<P>
  <I> Some of these very technical jobs require long & strange hours, weekends, travel, etc. that doesn't mesh well with
family responsibilities. </I>
<P>
  These make sense to me, because they tally with my view that, for the <EM>average</EM> man and the <EM>average</EM> woman,
some behaviors tend to be not only distinctive bu innate.  In this case, it's my theory that women tend to avoid technical
fields (computers, engineering, mathematics) in favor of "service" fields (teaching, nursing, real estate) because the former
don't allow women to be with people, and the latter do.  The typical woman is predisposed to finding happiness through human
relationships, while the typical man is biologically programmed to find satisfaction in tool-using (either actual physical
tools, or abstract tools like symbols).
<P>
  So it sounds reasonable to me that, if the "technical" part of tech support is emphasized, more men than women would be
represented in the workforce, because the average man is more willing than the average woman to spend time with machines
instead of with people.  And the same goes for working odd and unpredictable hours, and for extensive travel.  The
interpersonal relating stuff just doesn't matter as much to the average man as it does to the average woman.
<P>
  Thus, it's not a power struggle.  It's the simple, voluntary expression of innate preferences.  If there are fewer women
offering technical advice, I'm inclined to think that's because there are fewer women interested in technical matters to
begin with.
<P>
  Again, this isn't a value judgement; I am vehemently opposed to any suggestion that men are <EM>overall</EM> "superior" to women,
or vice-versa.  Furthermore, it is the case that the variation between individual women (or individual men) far exceeds the
variation between the (statistically) average man and the average woman.  In other words, just because most women tend to
prefer personal roles over technical roles does not mean that any individual woman must therefore be technically incompetent;
she may in fact be more proficient technically than the average man.  Only because we are here looking at large groups of
men and women--not individuals--is it appropriate to consider the tendencies of the average man and the average woman.
<P>
  Which is why, when you say:
<P>
  <I> There still aren't many men willing to stay home with the kids (frequently & for long periods of time) while the wife
is off on an international assignment.  (But if you know of any, I'm looking for one!  *grin*) </I>
<P>
  I can say: Hey, if you can bring home enough cash to keep me supplied with the very latest in computers and consumer
electronics, call me. *grin*
<P>
  <HR>
<P>
  <I> [Engineers] also seem to have an attitude towards women telling them what to do, I have found....the reaction is
generally "negative". *grin* </I>
<P>
  This is something I personally find to be one of the most fascinating aspects of the engineering discipline and the kinds
of people it attracts.
<P>
  The essential aspect of engineers is their lust for technical competency.  Most people don't have this craving to the
degree that engineers do, so each group finds it difficult to understand the other.  To an engineer, if you're not curious
enough and motivated enough to spend the majority of your time studying and working so as to demonstrate competency, then
you don't deserve respect.
<P>
  So how does this apply to women?  Most women are more interested in relationships among people than in working with "things."
<P>
  This is why there are so few women engineers.  Not because of any "hostile environment," but because most women simply
aren't interested in work that doesn't let them focus on interactions between people.  And engineers--not stupid people,
by and large--are perfectly capable of seeing this.
<P>
  Where they err is when they equate such preferences with "better" or "worse" instead of merely "different."
<P>
  So here's how it works: An engineer spends a lot of his time getting good at what he does, often in a specialized
subfield of some highly technical discipline.  This general determination to be competent is what he respects himself
for, so it becomes what he respects in others.
<P>
  Now along comes a woman.  Until and unless she demonstrates competency, his thinking will run something like this: If
she is "below" his level in the business hierarchy, he will presume that this is because she lacks the curiosity and
willingness to sacrifice personal life for technical competency to become proficient at something worthwhile.  Therefore
she is unworthy of respect.  And if she is at or above his level, he will tend to resent her because (to his mind) she
somehow managed to be rewarded with promotion--which he had to work hard to get--despite her lack of competency.  Thus,
once again, she does not deserve respect.
<P>
  There's more.  One thing that engineers don't do is assume that other people (including women) are stupid.  They tend
to think that everyone is as intelligent as they are.  Thus any failure to be competent must stem from a conscious
<EM>unwillingness</EM> to be technically curious and motivated, rather than an <EM>inability</EM> to be those things.  In
other words, it's not that women can't demonstrate technical competence; it's that they won't.  And this, to an engineer,
is an even worse sin, leading to even less respect.
<P>
  And all this presumes that we're talking about engineers who aren't already the "socially inept" kind!
<P>
  Of course, these misunderstandings aren't limited to engineers.  Women can exacerbate the problem by taking too
personally the attitudes of engineers, and by not demonstrating a recognition that individual competence is just as
important to business success as are harmonious working relationships.
<P>
  IMO, those organizations whose personnel have a conscious appreciation of both harmony and competence are the ones
capable of the greatest success.
<P>
  Somebody tell the engineers, OK? *grin*
