<H3>The Principles of Tit for Tat</H3>

<P>Axelrod distilled several principles from his observation of
how well Tit for Tat did against various defecting and
cooperating players. Not only do these explain how Tit for Tat
did better than even other cooperating players, they have useful
implications for real world human interactions.
</P>

<H4>Be Nice</H4>

<P>Don't be the first to defect. Assume cooperativeness on the
part of others. If you go into an interaction assuming that
you're going to get ripped off, then you might as well try to
take advantage of the other person. But if instead the other
person turns out to have been willing to cooperate with you,
you've just missed a chance for both of you to do well.
</P>

<H4>Be Forgiving</H4>

<P>Don't overreact. When taken advantage of, retaliate once, then
stop. Meeting one defection with a harsh response can create a
series of echoing mutual defections that prevent cooperation from
ever occurring.
</P>

<H4>Be Provocable</H4>

<P>When a defection occurs, always respond in kind. Don't be too
forgiving. In the instructions for the second tournament, Axelrod
included the two lessons (&quot;be nice&quot; and &quot;be
forgiving&quot;) that he had drawn from the first tournament.
Several of those who submitted second tournament strategies
concluded that being forgiving was essential to the evolution of
cooperation. Their strategies tended to let a few defections
slide. In effect, these strategies tried to elicit cooperation by
allowing not-nice players to take advantage of them without
penalty. But the actual result was to encourage not-nice
strategies to keep defecting. A lesser penalty for defecting made
that lack of cooperation more valuable, so cooperation became
less valuable.  A better choice is to always defect when provoked.
</P>

<H4>Be Clear</H4>

<P>Respond in kind immediately. Strategies that tried to be
clever tended to appear unresponsive, which elicited defection.
(If your attempts to cooperate are ignored, then you might as
well defect to get as much as you can while you can.) Cooperation
should meet with immediate cooperation, and a defection should be
met with an immediate defection.
