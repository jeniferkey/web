AUGUST 21 (Monday)     -- Edinburgh
</H3>

<P>
I awoke with a feeling of anticipation--today we would begin to see some of the places so 
prominent throughout the Scottish history I'd been reading for months.  Our day would be spent 
along what is called the Royal Mile.  This is the ancient road which climbs from Holyrood 
Palace and its abbey upwards past shops and hidden courtyards (called "closes") to the central 
landmark of the area, Edinburgh Castle.
</P>
<A HREF="sp_trp01.htm"><IMG SRC="./ScotImg/t_holyroo1.jpg" HEIGHT="100" WIDTH="150" BORDER=0 ALT="a clickable picture of the front of Holyrood Palace">Holyrood Palace</A>
<P>
Holyrood Palace had been around long before Mary Stuart, the doomed Queen of Scots, stamped 
it with her presence, but hers is the name most closely associated with it now.  We began by 
strolling through the ruined abbey adjoining the palace, where the dates carved into the stones 
told of the burials of Scottish nobility beginning nearly a thousand years ago.  The palace itself 
was an enclosed courtyard plan with tall corner towers (only one of which was open to the 
public).  Our tour of the palace was very much a tribute to Mary; reminders of her occupation 
were everywhere, from the sumptuous bedroom with its rich and finely detailed wooden ceiling 
painted with the initials of her royal parents to the wooden-floored room filled with momentos of 
the period--the very room in which Mary saw her secretary David Rizzio brutally murdered at 
the command of her vain and jealous husband Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, a cousin of Mary's.
</P>

<P>
Leaving the palace for the bustling, sunlit shops of the Royal Mile felt like closing the covers of 
a sad, tragic novel and going outside to play.  This spirit of being released seemed to have 
infected the other members of the group as well.  Every time I tried to corral them so that we 
wouldn't lose one another in the milling crowds, I got the strangest looks.  After a while I came 
to accept that we wouldn't all be lost forever if we got separated... but it took me several days, 
during which my fellow Lifestyles forum members each exercised the patience of Job with me.  They
were pretty patient while I found small gifts for my grandmothers, too.
<P>
Along the way we peered into the preserved home of the Protestant reformer, John Knox.  We also 
investigated St. Giles Cathedral, whose name survived the Protestant purging of all things "papist" 
(such as bishops and cathedrals).
</P>

<P>
Eventually we wended our way upwards through the busy streets to the castle.  Edinburgh Castle 
is an enormous stone pile built atop an extinct volcanic plateau; it is possible to see for miles 
from only part-way up the winding path leading to the summit.  Most of the castle itself has been 
torn down and rebuilt several times over the centuries, but, as our guide was quick to point out, 
the castle proper has never been taken by force of arms (although it did get captured occasionally
by deceit).
</P>

<P>
We very cleverly managed to arrive in time for a tour which began just before 1:00 p.m., which 
is when the "One o'clock Gun" (an anti-aircraft artillery gun of WWII vintage) is fired.  This 
marks the time for the city with a report that can be heard for several miles.  As our guide pointed 
out with a sly gleam in his eye, "Now, you may be wondering why it is that this gun is fired at 
one o'clock, rather than the more customary noon.  This is, of course, because firing the gun at 
noon would require the expenditure of eleven more rounds...."
<P>
There was far more to see at the castle than can be described in a few words: the small and 
simple St. Margaret's Chapel, the oldest roofed structure in Scotland; the shattered hulk of the 
great cannon Mons Meg; the rough-hewn (but chilly!) dungeons in which French, Dutch and 
American prisoners have languished; the Regimental Museum of the Royal Scots, Britain's 
oldest infantry regiment; the Scottish National War Memorial designed by Sir Robert Lorimer, in 
which the service of each WWII military branch (including the animal veterinary corps) is etched 
in stone; the tiny room in which James VI of Scotland (the future James I of England) was born 
under mysterious circumstances to Mary, Queen of Scots; the great hammer-beamed Banqueting 
Hall rebuilt by James IV, its walls encrusted with swords and polearms and guarded by suits of 
armor, wherein occurred  the infamous "Black Dinner" of 1440; and the fabulous Scottish Regalia: 
the Sceptre, Sword and Crown of Scotland, hidden away in a forgotten trunk after the Restoration 
and brought to light again only at the urging of the novelist Sir Walter Scott.  There is even a 
small piece of ground on the open Esplanade at the castle's entrance which, in a bit of legal 
legerdemain intended to fill the depleted coffers of the restored King Charles II, is considered 
to be territory belonging to the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.
<P>
And casting shadows all around is the looming solidity of centuries-old stone.
</P>

<P>
Eventually the scattered members of our party reformed just in time for supper.  Bill had done 
some research for us and found a place that sounded good.  The entrance turned out to be a 
stairway down to a cellar... but an extremely well-appointed cellar.  We were soon enjoying a 
meal that instantly put to rest any question of Scottish fare being unimaginative or bland; from 
the sauces to the wines to the after-dinner drinks to the service, it was one of the best meals I had 
during my visit.
<P>
And then, as the sun sank behind the castle in the west, we headed back to the castle for the 
evening's main event, the celebrated Military Tattoo.  To put it simply, this is a concert of 
massed pipe and drum corps.  But the simple description doesn't really convey what it felt like to 
sit in the stands on the Esplanade facing the imposing entrance to the castle.  Everyone in the 
crowd around us was grinning, ready for something exciting to happen.
<P>
At this point, we experienced a minor scare.  Ann had cleverly managed to get us the best seats in 
the house, not too far back, not too close, and directly facing the castle.  But somehow in all the 
excitement her own ticket had been left back at the hotel.  So while the rest of us turned 
concerned faces to one another, worried that Ann was going to miss most of the show while she 
went back to the hotel for the ticket, we tried to console ourselves by promising to take great 
pictures.  (Those of us who'd brought cameras, anyway.)  Suddenly we saw Ann, beaming and 
waving to us.  She had gone downstairs, obviously upset, and when someone with the Tattoo 
learned that she had no ticket but had reserved one, the computer records were checked then and 
there, and she was told, "Just go on up!"
<P>
So the show began.
</P>
<A HREF="sp_trp06.htm"><IMG SRC="./ScotImg/t_tattoo1.jpg"  HEIGHT="100" WIDTH="150" BORDER=0 ALT="a clickable picture of the start of the Military Tattoo">Military Tattoo Start</A>
<P>
It was a musical program; words are not going to be able to describe it 
adequately.  But suffice to say that it started with a bang--and I mean that literally.  As the first 
number ended, each of the seven cannons mounted in the Half Moon Battery facing us fired in 
turn, waking any in the crowd who might have been snoozing.  Then the two companies of 
Scottish pipers had their pipe and drum corps friends from France and Egypt (yes, Egypt) out in 
turn, each with their own special exhibitions.  This was followed by a spectacle; mounted actors 
portraying characters of French and Scottish history rode out of the castle in celebration of the 
700th anniversary of the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France, a long history of mutual 
military aid against the English (an agreement which, it must be admitted, was generally ignored 
when it suited the various Kings of France to do so).  Then came the dancers, ladies and 
gentlemen in skirt and kilt who performed intricate maneuvers while young women in the center 
of it all did the Highland Fling to the skirling of the pipes.
</P>

<P>
And then came the finale.  Out marched all the bands, massed in performance of a Saint-Saens 
number which featured a monstrously amplified pipe organ shaking every seat in the house as 
though in the hands of a giant who'd had one too many cups of coffee.  The lights dimmed, and 
out on the battlements of the castle strode a lone piper lit by a single spotlight.  We held our 
breath while the pure notes drifted out onto the evening breeze.  When the song ended and we sat 
quietly waiting, the strains of "Auld Lang Syne" began.  To my surprise, everyone in the crowd 
crossed hands, left over right, and clasped the hand of the person next to or behind him or her.  
So I did the same, and sang along as best I could, feeling welcomed here as though I and 
everyone else carried nothing but the purest of Scottish blood in our veins.
<P>
Finally, the music segued to Scotland the Brave, at which point the crowd remembered to 
breathe, and the cheering returned in a laughing, clapping, shouting crescendo.
</P>

<P>
While the others did some further partying, I went back to the hotel to sleep.  I couldn't imagine 
anything topping the Tattoo, and didn't want anything to try.
