<P>
  Since we've been talking about the various "do's and don'ts" of some Scottish traditions, I thought
  it might be worthwhile to discuss another tradition that is commonly misunderstood.  The one I have
  in mind concerns "coats of arms."
<P>
  It's widely believed that there is such a thing as a family coat of arms.  In fact, not only is there
  no such thing as a family coat of arms, claiming one that isn't legally yours can actually get you
  fined or even tossed in jail in Scotland.
<P>
  The reality is that "arms" are essentially a diploma of nobility.  Recognition of that nobility is
  at the pleasure of the Crown, which, at its sole discretion, may choose to grant patents of arms to
  individuals.  And that's the critical point: arms are a form of property which may belong <EM>only</EM>
  to individuals--never to whole families.
<P>
  The reason behind this goes back to the original purpose of arms.  A knight in the field often found
  it useful to be able to summon his men-at-arms.  To distinguish himself from other knights, he would
  adopt certain colors.  Later, as more knights were made, patterns and images began to be used.
<P>
  As this progressed over the centuries, it became difficult to tell one "coat of arms" from another.  Nor
  was there any way to prevent one lord from appropriating the colors or devices of another.  To restore
  order, the various Crowns of Europe arrogated to themselves the right to decide what arms might be borne
  by what noble.  And thus was born Heraldry.
<P>
  Over the years, heraldry took on the force of law.  In Scotland today, the Lord Lyon King of Arms
  (that's a title, not a name), as one of Her Majesty's highest-ranking administrative and judicial
  officers in Scotland, has real power to enforce his decisions as to who can have what arms and what
  those arms may look like.  If someone--be it an individual, a corporation, whoever--attempts to
  display or otherwise claim the use of arms without the Lord Lyon's permission, the Lord Lyon has the
  right and power to fine or even imprison the offending individual.
<P>
  The Scots take their heraldry seriously.  Under Scottish law, you don't get to claim to be a gentleman
  or lady unless you can prove it, and unless the Crown's representative agrees to assign to you and your
  heirs a patent of such nobility.
<P>
  Now, as to arms themselves.  The main confusion about a "coat of arms" (other than who can have one
  and under what circumstances) is that the term actually refers to the grant of nobility <EM>as
  represented by</EM> the stylized image with with such grants are conferred.  In other words, the
  picture of shield and helmet and so on is just the visual representation of the actual patent of arms.
<P>
  The proper name given to this visual representation is an "achievement."  An achievement is composed
  of several elements.  They are:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>the shield and its devices (this is the <EM>real</EM> "coat of arms," often simply called "the arms")</LI>
<LI>the helmet, of which there are six types indicating degree of nobility</LI>
<LI>the wreath, which is the rope-like cord at the base of the helmet made of the livery colors</LI>
<LI>the crest, a single figure which in some way describes the person being honored (about which more below)</LI>
<LI>the mantling (which originally was the cloth worn about the helmet to protect the wearer's neck from the hot metal)</LI>
<LI>the motto (usually though not always a Latin inscription)</LI>
<LI>various other elements (such as supporters or coronets) which are authorized by the Lord Lyon only in certain circumstances</LI>
</OL>

<P>
  Concerning the crest: It has been Scottish custom for a clansman who wishes to identify himself as a
  follower of his chief to wear a metal device consisting of his chief's crest encircled by a
  strap-and-buckle.  This concept has been distorted into the beliefs that anyone may properly wear
  just the crest without the strap-and-buckle, or the crest (even if within a strap-and-buckle) of
  someone who may be a chief or chieftain but who has not been recognized as arms-bearing by the Lord
  Lyon... but these beliefs are mistaken.
<P>
  If you go to Scotland, you may find jewelers who will be happy to sell you "your family crest."  Just
  remember that there's no such thing, since crests, as part of a grant of arms, don't belong to families
  but to <EM>individuals</EM>.  What's more, even if you wear a proper crest, you're not claiming to be
  a member of some family; you're claiming to be a <EM>personal follower</EM> of the particular individual
  who has been granted the use of that crest by the Lord Lyon.  The same crest may be used in many
  different achievements, but only one person at a time will have the right to be recognized by that
  crest alone.  (In Scotland, this is usually the chief of a recognized clan... who, because he or she
  is the chief, will <EM>not</EM> wear the crest within a strap-and-buckle!)
<P>
  So where does this notion of a "family crest" or "family coat of arms" come from?  The source of
  this misunderstanding is the fact that the arms of a parent are legally inheritable by a natural
  child of that parent through a process called "matriculation."
<P>
  In this process, when the owner of a grant of arms dies (or, as sometimes happens, renounces the
  claim to those arms), that person's eldest son (or daughter if there is no son) is entitled to
  petition the Lord Lyon for the sole use of the parent's unique arms.  In most cases, this petition
  is granted, and the arms are granted unchanged to the heir.  (Note: the heir to arms is permitted
  to use the owner's arms, though not as his own but as "my father's arms" or "my mother's arms," and
  with some temporary mark of difference added to the heir's arms to distinguish them from the
  parent's.)  In this way, a coat of arms can pass unchanged through several generations, leading to
  the perhaps understandable but nevertheless incorrect conclusion that those arms belong to the
  family in common.
<P>
  However, this misunderstanding is made clear when the case of younger sons is considered.  They
  are not permitted the use of the arms of their parent <EM>without modification</EM>, since the
  whole point of arms is to uniquely identify the holder and direct heirs of a patent of
  nobility.  A younger son is, however, permitted to petition the Lyon Court for the use of a
  parent's arms with some difference.  That is, the shield (or, in the case of a woman, a
  diamond-shaped "lozenge") is altered (the proper term is "differenced") so as to retain the
  basic characteristics of the parent's arms while distinguishing them sufficiently with a mark of
  cadency to make them unique.  Again, the Lyon Court usually grants such requests for a small fee.
<P>
  Finally... so you say you'd like your own coat of arms?  For a patent of arms as recognized by
  the laws of Scotland (which I would advise, since Scotland has the strongest legal protections
  of such grants), there are two ways in which this might be accomplished.  (Though, for U.S.
  citizens, there is the proviso of Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution of the United States
  which specifies that "...no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,
  without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any Present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any
  kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.")
<P>
  First, you may petition the Lord Lyon for a patent of arms on your own behalf.  While not
  impossible, this can be difficult without having been recognized for some public honors.  In
  the United Kingdom, this typically takes the form of being created a peer, baronet or knight...
  which may give you some idea of the level of effort required to merit a patent of arms.  Also,
  this approach is not cheap--in 1962 it would have cost upwards of $300.  It is also worth noting
  that the Lord Lyon, acting in this case in a Ministerial function, speaks with the voice of the
  Crown in terms of Royal prerogative.  In other words, if the Lord Lyon for whatever reason turns
  down your request for arms in your own name, that decision is final.  There is no appeal to a
  higher authority because there is no higher authority than the Crown, in whose name the Lord Lyon
  speaks on matters of armorial bearings (among other things).
<P>
  The second approach to obtaining arms is a form of rematriculation in which you attempt to prove
  your descent from an arms-bearing ancestor.  If approved, you would receive a patent of arms most
  likely consisting of the basic arms of your ancestor suitably differenced for you.  The burden of
  proof rests on you to provide birth certificates, marriage licenses, and other official documents
  as required to establish descent.  This method is somewhat less expensive than asserting a right
  in your own name, but it will require you to provide evidence supporting your claim of
  descent.  Interestingly, in this case the Lord Lyon acts as a judge, and so his decision to refuse
  to certify a grant of arms may be appealed.  The appeal in this case is to the Inner House of the
  Court of Session; it is not cheap, and the fact that the Lord Lyon has seen fit to question your
  claim will be given considerable weight by the Court of Session.
<P>
  One thing common to both processes is that the specific form of the achievement devised is solely
  up to the Lyon Court and may not be appealed.  Although you may be asked to supply some biographical
  highlights in order to devise a suitable achievement, the final determination rests entirely with
  the Lyon Court.  If you don't like what they come up with, too bad for you.
<P>
  So why would you want to go through this?  I'll let Sir Thomas Innes, Lord Lyon King of Arms in
  the early 1960s, have the last word: "Any man who says he is a gentleman may just as well have
  the courage of his convictions, and affirm it with heraldry, which establishes that the Crown has
  accepted him as such."
