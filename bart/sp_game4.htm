      Wil Wright's Sim City simultaneously created a new genre of game
      and led to a new way of thinking about the purpose of games.  It
      could be played competitively in the sense of trying to achieve
      the highest score for one's city, but it wasn't designed for that
      purpose.  Instead, Sim City and its descendants were imagined as
      what Wright has called "software toys."  The point wasn't to reach
      some predefined conclusion, but to use computers as exploratory
      tools.  (In the usual West Coast metaphor, arriving at some
      destination is less important than the journey itself.)  Not
      surprisingly, educators were among the most enthusiastic adopters
      of Sim City.  While it was far from being an accurate or complete
      simulation of local municipal government, it captured the essence:
      trying to satisfy multiple incompatible priorities.  Besides, it
      was fun, which doesn't hurt when you're trying to keep someone's
      attention.

    <TD>
      As with other highly addictive games, Sim City's interface with
      the player demonstrated two features: a wide variety of simple
      choices to make, and lots of feedback (in this case, city
      management problems to solve, such as fires, traffic, and power
      outages).  Having a sufficiently broad palette of actions that can
      be taken lets the player feel in control; it induces the belief
      that the player can "win."  (There may be biological reality
      behind such beliefs.  As one of the observations of Systemantics
      puts it: "Control of a system is exercised by the element with the
      greatest variety of behavioral responses.")  And the feedback is
      important, too, because it persuades the player that what he or
      she does with all those available behavioral options matters
      within the game universe.  Being presented with challenges that
      are consistent with the game universe (and which are neither too
      easy nor too difficult) evokes player involvement, and generates
      that "Well, just one more turn" impulse that designers strive to
      achieve.  Sim City accomplished this dual goal very well, and
      deserves its recognition as one of the best computer games ever
      published.

    <TD>
      Sim City would have earned a "high" rating for replayability had
      it not appeared so simple to the player.  (Something its sequel,
      Sim City 2000, tried to correct.)  Once you had a self-sustaining
      city--one capable of continuous slow growth while taxes produced a
      small annual surplus--much of the challenge of the game
      ebbed.  After that the player became merely a caretaker
      official... and, as seen in the public's rejection of the
      caretaker president Bush for the "quick-change artist" Clinton,
      many people find simply preserving what works to be boring.  They
      want the emotional satisfaction of feeling that they've "made a
      difference."  Which is perhaps part of the reason why (maybe
      because he understood boredom with systems that work) Wright added
      random disasters to Sim City's options.  (The other reason being
      that it's a hoot to watch Godzilla stomp blithely through one's
      carefully-constructed city.)  But in the end even disasters aren't
      enough.  While there were often large numbers of problems for a
      player to solve, the original Sim City just didn't have enough
      variety in the <EM>kinds</EM> of problems needing solution.  And
      so, although addictive enough to lead most players to try the
      different scenarios provided, and possibly even to create their
      own, Sim City palled quickly afterwards.

      Overall, Sim City deserves as much credit for opening up another
      way of thinking about games as for being fun to play on its own
      merits.  While there is and should be plenty of room for games in
      which "competition" is not a dirty word, there is and should be
      plenty of room for more open-ended alternatives, too.  The
      computer game market is not a zero-sum game; just because someone
      plunks down cash for Quake today doesn't mean she won't buy Sim
      City 2000 next week.  So by all means, developers should consider
      Wil Wright's innovative game design concepts.  Where today is the
      multi-player game that--like the real world--offers desirable
      incentives for both competitive and cooperative behavior?  Are we
      stuck with Ultima Online?  Or would a Sim City Online game which
      would allow individuals to simulate participatory democracy strike
      a responsive chord?
