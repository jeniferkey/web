<H3>ESTP -- The Promoter</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  When the word "entrepreneur" was first used, chances are very good
that the person the coiner of the word had in mind was an ESTP.  Of
all the types, ESTPs are probably the best at observing their fellow
human beings for fun and profit.
<P>
  Where the ISTP manipulates things, the ESTP is the master manipulator
of people.  It is a testiment to the skill of the typical ESTP that
most people know that they are being manipulated and don't mind it,
because it is done with such adroitness and sense of fun.  When the
ESTP wants something from you, more often than not you will find
yourself happy to hand it over.  The typical ESTP is such a charmer,
not because he or she possesses any special talent of empathy, but due
to a highly-developed awareness of the signals people give off.  Even
on the telephone, a talented ESTP can figure out just what it is that
will persuade you.
<P>
  ESTPs are masters of their social environments.  If an ESTP invites
you out for dinner, you can usually count on waitstaff to know the ESTP
by name.  (And more often than not, the ESTP will be on a first name
basis with the staff as well.)  Accomplished storytellers, ESTPs are
not above embellishing the truth in order to make the story more
interesting, even when the unadorned truth would be fascinating
enough.
<P>
  Those who work or live with ESTPs on a long-term basis, however, may
find this breezy attitude somewhat wearing.  ESTPs, who relish their
independence as much as any other Perceivers, tend to develop many
shallow acquaintances but few deep relationships.  Consequently,
spouses and coworkers can sometimes feel as though they are kept around
solely for their utility in the ESTP's many schemes, and that they never
come to truly know the ESTP any better than when they first met.
<P>
  ESTPs can appear unpredictable, as well.  Like ESFPs, if life begins
to see too predictable to an ESTP, they may begin to act in ways that
make life more "interesting," sometimes gambling not just their own
resources but those of their employer or their family as well.  They
may be able to charm you into liking it for a while, but eventually it
becomes important for ESTPs to demonstrate that they are capable of
accepting and fulfilling responsibilities.  Other types can help by
giving the ESTP the freedom to do so.  Nagging will only induce the
ESTP's avoidance behavior; he or she will simply tune out interpersonal
problems.  And because the ESTP is so good at hiding unhappiness under
a barrage of good-natured extraversion, only those who are most
intimately acquainted with the ESTP will have any notion of how
despondent he or she may be.
<P>
  An ESTP who has settled down somewhat, though, is likely to be as
happy most of the time as he or she appears.  And when an ESTP is
happy, so is everyone else!
