<H4>I. Hey, Bart, what makes you think you need a Web page?</H4>

<P>
For various reasons (see my <A HREF="nt_per7.htm">Personality</A> section),
I haven't always been able to let the people I care about know what I
think and feel and believe. Putting my thoughts together in a Web format
is simply a convenient way to organize and express them.
</P>

<HR>

<BR>
<H4>
II. Fine, but what's with this weird format? Wouldn't a blog be easier?
</H4>

<P>
When I first created this site back in 1998, blogs didn't exist.
<P>
I may eventually move this stuff into a blog format. (On the other hand,
by the time I get to it, something will probably have come along that
makes blogs look like old technology. So it goes.)
</P>

<HR>

<BR>
<H4>
III. OK, but couldn't you have made this stuff more attractive and fun
to root around in?
</H4>

<P>
This site's not perfect.  There are any number of ways it could be made
better.  (If you insist on knowing those ways <EM>right now</EM>, check
out <A HREF="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/" TARGET="NEW">
WebPagesThatSuck.com</A> for the Web's best introduction to how to
build sites that... well, that don't suck.)
<P>
Currently, I see three areas for improvement:

<UL>
<LI>Design (enhanced graphics, better consistency of appearance)</LI>
<LI>Content (new essays, better integration among essays)</LI>
<LI>Interactivity (less info-dumping, more personalized access)</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Moving to a blog format will probably help both visually and organizationally.
I also plan to add a lot more cross-linkage between topics to reflect how
they're related inside my skull.
</P>

<HR>

<BR>
<H4>
IV. Your use of big words doesn't impress me.  Why do you do that?
</H4>

<P>
I'm not trying to impress anyone.  My goal is to communicate concepts
that are often hard to express clearly.  Simple and direct language has
real value, and I try to use it where possible.  But when faced with a
choice between a simple word that doesn't carry the nuance I want and
a less common (but still valid) word that does, I'll go with the less
common word because I really care about precision in communication.
<P>
Trying to find just the right words is hard work, but I consider making
that effort to be my part of the bargain in trying to communicate.  If
you run into a word you don't know, you can hold up your end of the
deal by taking a few moments to look up that word.
</P>

<HR>

<BR>
<H4>
V. I disagree strongly with one (or several) of your opinions.
</H4>

<P>
OK, I can respect principled disagreement.  If you feel you need to
enlighten me, or if you'd just like to comment on some aspect of this
site, you can use your favorite mail tool to send me email at:
<P>
Bart[underscoresymbol]Stewart[atsymbol]prodigy.net
<P>
(You'll need to replace the "underscoresymbol" and "atsymbol" with the
appropriate "_" amd "@" symbols -- sorry, but the spam has just gotten
to be too much to leave my actual address in plaintext. Sign of the
times....)
<P>
For the record, courteous responses are always welcome.  If you make a
good point and I can find the time, I'll try to reply, but please don't
hold me to that.
<P>
Thanks for reading!
</P>
