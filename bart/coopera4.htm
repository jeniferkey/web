<H3>How Cooperation Works</H3>

<P>What actual, emotion-driven human beings do with individual
choices of cooperation or defection is, of course, unpredictable.
But in general, rational players will tend to make similar
choices. This allows those interested in human behavior to work
out some mathematical predictions of behavior that,
interestingly, can be shown to be always true.
<P>
In this case, it turns out that a careful choice of the four
payoffs for cooperation or defection results in being able to say
that there exists a rational choice of cooperation, even in the
midst of a majority of defectors. Specifically, Axelrod found
that if just four conditions were met, cooperation can be the
most rational choice--even in a population consisting almost
entirely of defectors.
<P>
First, the players must be able to recognize one another.
Anonymity, becauses it decreases the penalty for defection in an
environment of iterated interactions, tends to work against the
evolution of a population of cooperators.
<P>
Second, the total number of potential opportunities for
interaction must be unknown to each player. It is the uncertainty
preventing players from calculating just how much defection they
can get away with that decreases the long-term reward for
defection. If you don't know when your final interaction will be,
and thus can't plan to defect on that turn, you must take into
your calculations the fact that what you do on this interaction
will affect the response to you on the next interaction. This
creates an incentive to cooperate.
<P>
Third, the payoff for mutual cooperation (that is, both
players cooperate with each other) in each interaction must be
greater than the average payoff of a cooperation-defection (the
payoff to the defector plus the sucker's payoff divided by 2). In
mathematical terms, this is the condition in which R &gt; (P + S)
/ 2.
<P>
Fourth and last, there must be a certain minimum proportion of
cooperating players in the population... and here was one of the
greatest surprises. Axelrod calculated that--amazingly--if all
the preceding conditions are met, and there is a high probability
that players which have interacted before will do so again
(specifically, ninety percent), then cooperation can eventually
evolve to include the entire population if only <em>five percent</em>
of the total initial population consists of cooperators. It's
reasonable to expect that there must be enough cooperators so
that they can create a sort of island of trust in a sea of
defection. What's surprising is that so few are necessary.
