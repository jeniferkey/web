<H4>III. SYSTEM DESIGN GUIDELINES: NUMBER</H4>

<BR>
<B>1. New systems mean new problems.</B>
<P>
Systems are created to solve some problem.  The trouble is, the moment a
system is created it brings into being an entirely new set of problems
related to the general behavior of all systems.  Instead of there being
just the one original problem, now there is the original problem
<EM>plus</EM> the problems generated by the new system.
<P>
If the new system works (as happens on rare occasions), this situation
might be considered a fair trade-off.  But of course it won't last.  A
working system always expands.  Eventually this system--despite the best
intentions of its creators and functionaries--will expand to the point
that its problems outweigh its products.  If it continues to survive, at
some point the system's problems will come to be regarded <EM>as
desirable products</EM>.
<P>
And yet we persist in thinking we can solve problems by throwing systems
at them.
</P>

<BR>
<B>2. Systems should not be unnecessarily multiplied.</B>
<P>
The lesser-known formulation of Occam's Razor.  (The usual form is,
"Given a choice between two systems, choose the simpler.")
<P>
Again, the point is that the problems generated by multiple systems
don't add together arithmetically (three systems with three problems
each together make six problems).  In fact, the problems expand
geometrically or even exponentially (three systems with three problems
each combine to produce nine problems or more).  This is because it's
not enough to simply see the visible pieces of a system--you also have
to consider the <EM>relationships</EM> between the pieces, the
interactions of all the problems... and that's where the combinatorial
explosion happens.
</P>

<BR>
<B>
3.<P>
Do it without a new system if you can.<P>
Do it with an existing system if you can.<P>
Do it with a little system if you can.</P>
</B>
<P>
In other words, if you can, don't assume that you have to design and
implement a new system to solve your problem.  If after careful thought
you conclude that some system is required, don't assume that you have to
build a completely new system from scratch.  And if a new system does
seem to be called for, don't assume that it has to be a big one that
will do everything that will ever be needed.
</P>

<BR>
<B>4. Escalating the wrong solution will not improve the outcome.</B>
<P>
Example: In the world of software development, projects sometimes wind
up being delayed.  Humans can make mistakes; requirements can change;
resources can be denied--there are numerous events that can affect a
plan for the worse.
<P>
What we do know is that adding more systems to prevent failure often
makes the problem worse.  The IBM "human-wave" method of overcoming
programming defects is a classic example of this.  Rather than removing
distractions from small teams whose members all know and can communicate
with each other, executives reason (if that is the word) that if five
programmers can write a program in five days, twenty-five programmers
should be able to write the same program in one day.
<P>
What actually happens is that the multiplication of systems (in this
case, programmers) massively increases the amount of communication
required to achieve the desired goal.  The more systems that have to
function together, the more time they spend trying to communicate rather
than actually working the problem.
<P>
Sometimes, less is better.
</P>

<BR>
<B>5. If a problem seems unsolvable, consider that you may have a
metaproblem.</B>
<P>
In other words, it may be that the problem you're trying to solve is
itself the result of some other, deeper problem.  In such a case,
figuring out the real problem may give you the necessary insight to
solve the lesser problem, or even make its solution unnecessary.
