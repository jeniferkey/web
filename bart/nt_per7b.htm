<H2>The <I>I Ching</I> and Temperament</H2>

<P>
I recently found myself reading a copy of the Chinese book known as the
<I>I Ching</I>. (My copy is the version with concordance and translated
by Ritsema and Karcher, published in 1995 by Barnes and Noble Books.)
This is a text that in different forms for several thousand years has
been used for divining a person's future based on the random fall of 49
sticks or three coins. The patterns of the objects are interpreted by
consulting the <I>I Ching</I> to describe the 64 possible variations.
<P>
Although I discount the mystical powers attributed to such things, it
seemed to me as I read that there was something familiar about this
system of self-understanding. Despite the encrustation of complexity
over the years, at its core the <I>I Ching</I> appeared to be founded
on observations about human personality. I wondered: Was there any link
here to temperament theory?
<P>
At the center of this Eastern system of knowledge is a simple distinction
between "yin" and "yang." Just as we associate certain complementary
characteristics to the Sensing and iNtuitive preferences, the qualities
of yin and yang are widely understood as having distinct characteristics.
<P>
Yang is the active principle, the concept of motion, of thrust and drive,
of forming goals and progressing toward them. Yang is change, newness,
destruction of what is to create what might be. In ideas, yang imposes.
<P>
Yin is the opposite of yang. As yang is identified with action, yin is
held to carry the concepts of structure, of boundaries and limits, of
the specific and the understood. Yin builds fixed forms, and it
concentrates and consolidates what is in the present. In ideas, yin
adapts.
<P>
To me, the descriptions of yin and yang sound very much like my
descriptions of attitudes toward the unknown and the known. On the one
hand is yang, the change-seeking principle; on the other hand we have
yin, the structure-seeking principle. This correlation is admittedly
subjective... but I find it strongly suggestive. It seems to me that
human nature (which is what all these concepts are trying to describe)
has remained extremely consistent across time and distance. So why
should two different systems for understanding human nature not share
some descriptive features?
<P>
If this can be accepted, then what becomes interesting is the possibility
of a difference in Eastern and Western characters. While in Westerners
the fundamental attribute of temperament appears to be one's choice of
Sensing or iNtuition (concrete vs. abstract, world vs. self), it would
seem that the key difference between persons in the East is between
"action" and "structure," or yang and yin, and that an abstract or
concrete style of communication is a secondary concern at best.
<P>
Perhaps someone will find this interesting enough to investigate
further. Meanwhile, there turned out to be other apparent similarities
between the <I>I Ching</I> and temperament theory.
<P>
The <I>I Ching</I> incorporates the principles of yang and yin in its
system of "lines." The opened ("--- ---") and whole ("-------") lines
represent yin and yang, respectively. It then added two variations on
these lines in the concept of "transformation." An open line may
transform into a whole line; this is represented by the image
"---X---". And a whole line may transform into an open line,
respresented by "---O---".
<P>
At some point in its development, it was perceived that this system
could be viewed as a cycle. Starting with yang in its "youngest" form
("-------"), this was held to be the potential for action, and related
to the season of spring. As young yang transformed over time, becoming
extreme yang in its gradual transition into yin, it became actual
action ("---O---"), such as that in the summer growing season.
<P>
The new, young yin ("--- ---") was seen as the time for beginning to
consolidate one's goods, the potential structure of the autumn
harvesting season. And the period of actual structure ("---X---") in
which yin has matured to its fullest expression was considered the
season of winter's trial, when energies are concentrated and held in
check.
<P>
The completed pattern, then, could be represented as a looping circle,
or in a matrix read clockwise starting from the upper left quadrant:

<P>
Does this not resemble the diagram of "opposite" temperaments? Consider:
Spring, the young yang time of new activity, is held by the <I>I Ching</I>
to be described as "potential action." This sounds to me much like the
NF's idealism, full of ideas and passion to begin new things. And it's
hard not to see in the SP Artisan's restless activity the extreme yang
fullness of "actual action" in the long days of summer when there is
work to be done.
<P>
Likewise, the Guardian SJ concern with property and with conserving
resources against hard times to come is reflected in the "potential
structure" of young yin, of autumn's harvest and storage. Finally, the
extreme yin quality of "actual structure" so necessary in the difficult
winter may be seen in the Rational NT's intense focus on efficiency and
self-sufficiency, on reducing incoherent data to fundamental principles.
<P>
I may be reaching here, seeing correspondences where none exist merely
because I wish to see them. Still, I can't quite shake the feeling that
buried underneath all the pseudo-science complexity of the modern <I>I
Ching</I> there is a kernel of truth about human nature. If that is so,
then perhaps temperament theory has another small piece of supporting
evidence to stand alongside invocations of Galen's "four humours."

<H3>Thinking Styles and Temperament</H3>

<P>
While doing a Web search on temperament styles, I noticed an intriguing
comment in a paper on the Web titled
"<A HREF="http://www.edfac.usyd.edu.au/projects/comped/V2N1/Lumb.html">
Thinking styles and accessing information on the world wide web</A>".
<P>
The relevant bit states:
</P>

<PRE>
    Sternberg & Lubart (1991a) proposes that there is a link between
    intellectual (or thinking) style and creativity.  Truly striking levels
    of creativity are associated with global and legislative thinking styles
    compared with local executive thinking styles.  Individuals with a
    global legislative thinking style prefer relatively large abstract issues,
    ignoring details.  They prefer the task of creating, formulating, imagining
    and planning.  Individuals with local styles prefer concrete problems
    requiring detailed work and tend to be pragmatically oriented.  They prefer
    implementing and applying ideas or plans of others.
</PRE>

<P>
These descriptions sound to me very much like a recognition of temperament,
in particular of NTs and SPs.  (I further note that these two styles are
"opposites" in my model, something the Sternberg and Lubart reference
appears to be describing as well.)
<P>
The University of Sydney paper clearly distinguishes between "local" and
"global" styles as being "concrete" and "abstract," respectively--which
is precisely the Sensing/iNtuitive split highlighted by Myers-Briggs,
Keirsey and myself.  Now, assuming I'm adequately understanding what's
meant by "legislative" and "executive," I think we can construct another
diagram, this one fitting the Sydney paper's concepts into the Keirsey
temperament model:

<H3>Temperament and Organizational Cultures</H3>

<P>
In his classic work on organizational patterns and behaviors,
<I>Understanding Organizations</I>, Charles Handy describes his concept
of organizational cultures. Specifically, he suggests that there are
four (there's that number four again!). In this he notes that he is
following a paper by R. Harrison, "How to Describe Your Organization,"
<I>Harvard Business Review</I>, Sept.-Oct., 1972.
<P>
First, Handy states forthrightly that organizations have discernable
cultures, or internal process expectations, and that these cultures are
derived from the attitudes of those who lead organizations. As Handy
puts it: "Not all cultures suit all purposes and people. Cultures are
founded and built over the years by the dominant groups in an
organization." If that's so, then shouldn't organizational cultures
reflect temperament?
<P>
Handy lends support to an answer of "yes," suggesting that four
particular kinds of organizational cultures exist. As named by Harrison,
they are: Power, Role, Task, and Person. The very names are suggestive
of the four temperaments, but let's look at each more closely.
</P>

<H4>Power Culture</H4>
<P>
The Power culture is defined by personal control over subordinates. It
rewards risk-taking, and minimizes security and bureaucracy in favor of
mobility and personal responsibility. It is a highly entrepreneurial
style, but this can also mean occasionally wasting resources on risky
schemes that fail to pay off. Such an organization tends to suffer from
span-of-control problems as it grows beyond a certain small size. At the
personal level, some people find this culture abrasive, and don't enjoy
the highly competitive atmosphere. But such organizations can be highly
effective as long as they are small enough to be nimble, and the
individual at the center of things is skillful and motivated. An example
of a group likely to demonstrate a Power culture would be virtually any
Sales team.
</P>

<H4>Role Culture</H4>
<P>
The Role culture, as its name suggests, tends to view the world in terms
of fulfilling carefully defined requirements. In this kind of culture,
process is king. There may be an overall goal, but that goal will be
reached by making sure that every task is done by the book, and every
interaction is defined by a paragraph in a manual of "policies and
procedures." This kind of culture excels at maintaining and conserving,
but is ill-equipped for innovating or exploiting. It can have great
difficulty responding to changes in its environment, whether challenges
or opportunities. The Role culture favors security over risk-taking, and
steadiness over creativity. It tends toward bureaucratic inertia, but
generally won't shock shareholders, either. Most organizations that grow
to have many thousands of participants tend to become Role cultures. A
Role culture can be found in larger organizations whose products rely on
economies of scale, or which are near monopolies--government agencies
being a prime example.
</P>

<H4>Task Culture</H4>
<P>
The Task culture is goal-oriented. If there is only one job requirement,
that requirement will be "competence." Although each part of the whole
is expected to be effective, this culture places a high value on
teamwork. Indeed, as new tasks are perceived, new teams will be formed
to address those tasks, leading to a highly flexible and innovative
organization. With less emphasis on power derived from position or from
force of personality, a Task culture is most adaptable to changes in its
environment. But its emphasis on expert power can also mean an extremely
challenging workplace, where competence is required and must be
demonstrated regularly. This focus on ends can produce a workplace that
seems chaotic and personally contentious; for those comfortable in such
an environment, extraordinary productivity can be achieved. Probably the
best examples today of a Task culture are computer game development
companies.
</P>

<H4>Person Culture</H4>
<P>
The Person culture exists to facilitate personal interactions. If there
is a goal for such a culture, it is likely to be harmonious
interpersonal activity. As long as the organization fosters this
atmosphere, the individuals who comprise that organization will stay;
when time or size changes the environment, the participants will simply
leave. "Power," which in some form drives the three other cultures,
simply doesn't apply to an organization that exists only so long as its
individual members freely interact to create that organization.  For
this reason the Person culture is rarely found intact in the business
world, which survives by meeting external requirements for products or
services. Instead, this kind of organization serves only the internal
requirements of the group. It emerges as persons get together
voluntarily to enjoy each other's company. Prime examples of such an
organization today are the on-line chat rooms and discussion groups.
</P>

<P>
Having examined the four cultures in Handy's terms, I find it very
difficult to avoid seeing obvious correspondences with Keirsey's four
temperaments. The correspondences (addressed in detail below) look to
me like this:
</P>

<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR><TD><B>CULTURE</B></TD><TD><B>TEMPERAMENT</B></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Power</TD><TD>SP Artisan</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Role</TD><TD>SJ Guardian</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Task</TD><TD>NT Rational</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Person</TD><TD>NF Idealist</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<H4>Power and the Artisan</H4>
<P>
Handy's Power culture sounds very much like an organization put together
by one of Keirsey's Artisans. The more extraverted Artisans in
particular seem to be highly entrepreneurial, starting their own
businesses with lots of hands-on control. As time passes, however, most
SPs find that running a business is much less fulfilling than starting
one. The maintenance of a thing, which is more a Guardian's forte, can
be boring to an Artisan almost to the point of pain. This echoes
attitudes found in a Power culture, where responding on-the-fly to new
challenges and opportunities is far more rewarding than doing "the same
old thing" day after day. As with Artisans, a Power culture emphasizes
mobility, not to achieve any particular goal but simply because it's
enjoyable to demonstrate grace in responding to challenges and
opportunities.
</P>

<H4>Roles and the Guardian</H4>
<P>
I can't imagine someone familiar with temperament theory reading a
description of the Role culture and not immediately being reminded of
the Guardian temperament. Both the culture and the temperament are
described as being focused on process rather than goals, on
maintaining rather than innovating or exploiting, and on impersonal
standards rather than voluntary personal associations. The resistance to
risk-taking in a Role culture is particularly revealing; it fits nicely
with the Guardian's strong preference for security and the comfort of
the well-understood, for making sure that the things which need to get
done are seen to properly.
</P>

<H4>Tasks and the Rational</H4>
<P>
As with Guardians and the Role culture, Rationals seem to be perfect
representatives of the Task culture. Much of the literature concerning
Rationals is clear on their insistence that respect must be earned by
demonstrated competence, that authority (Power) or rules (Role) or
"getting along" (Person) are immaterial compared to "getting the job
done right." In many ways, the Task culture is also a culture of
experts. Individuals are expected to have knowledge of their fields
that extends well beyond simple repetitive functions; in a Task culture
they will be expected to innovate, and to work with other innovators to
achieve the organization's larger goals. This is what the Rational lives
for!
</P>

<H4>Persons and the Idealist</H4>
<P>
If there is a natural organization for the Idealist, it must be the
Person culture. The Idealist can appreciate the energy of the Power
culture, but the constant competitiveness and willingness to manipulate
people make it hard for the NF to enjoy him- or herself. Nor will an
Idealist feel comfortable for very long in Task or Role cultures, where
personal interaction is either ignored or frowned upon. Given that an NF
believes that what matters most is the quality of his or her
relationships, and that the Person culture is explicitly dedicated to
experiencing those personal relationships, an Idealist is likely to feel
most confortable in some kind of Person culture. Given the relative
rarity of such cultures in the business world, it is likely that the
great majority of Idealists will find more satisfaction in their
personal lives and projects than they do at work.
</P>

<H4>Conclusion</H4>
<P>
It's tempting to conclude that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the four organizational cultures of Harrison and Handy and the
four temperaments described by Keirsey. In other words, it seems highly
likely that the four-fold "temperament" and "organizational culture"
models are two independently-developed ways of describing a uniquely
recognizable personality forms. The text definitions given for each of
the four aspects in both models appear to match up one for one, which
seems unlikely to occur by accident even if one takes into account a
subjective wish on my part to perceive correspondences that don't
actually exist. Even accepting that some level of such subjectivity
exists, the correspondence between every one of the four parts of both
models still seems too close to be illusory.
<P>
Guardians, for example, are (by Keirsey's descriptions) most likely to
be concerned with everyone fitting into what they feel are their proper
roles. Likewise, the Task culture, so focused on goals and results,
should sound perfectly familiar to any Rational who has worked in an
engineering or scientific environment. It seems equally clear that
Artisans (particularly the extraverted SPs), more than any other
temperament, will feel at home in a Power culture, where the skilled
manipulation of things and people is not merely tolerated but encouraged
and rewarded. Finally, while the Idealist temperament and the Person
culture do seem to describe fundamentally the same world-view, the
inadaptability of the Person culture to the commercial world has meant
fewer of such cultures available for study, and thus less supporting
material for declaring that the Person culture and the Idealist
temperament are merely different aspects of the same mindset.
<P>
All this considered, however, I find the connections between these two
systems to be highly persuasive. Apparently Keirsey and Harrison were
both perceptive observers of the basic elements of human nature.
