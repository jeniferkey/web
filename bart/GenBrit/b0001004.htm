Immediately after the death of ATHELSTAN, Olaf Guthfrithson, King of Dublin (who had been soundly defeated by ATHELSTAN at Brunanburh in
937) invaded northern England again... but this time York was surrendered to him by EDMUND without even a fight. After Olaf died in 941,
EDMUND was able recover York in 944. After an invasion of Strathclyde, that land was given to the Scottish king MALCOLM II. Though it
returned to its prior king, Dunmail, two years later, this arrangement established the friendly ties between England and Scotland that
would lead to the marriage of MALCOLM III and Margaret Atheling.
EDMUND died 26 MAY 946 in Pucklechurch, Gloucestershire, killed while defending his steward from a criminal who had returned from
banishment.  His body was interred in Glastonbury, Abbeyal, London, Eng. King of England 940-946.
