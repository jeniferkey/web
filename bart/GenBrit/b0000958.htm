<A NAME="i959"></A>He married unknown.  Cynedda (Cunedda) was thought by Nennius to have come to Gwynedd from the
"Men of the North"--what today is southern Scotland.  The theory is that Cunedda was of the tribe of the Votadini, and
that numbers of these migrated into northern Wales (pushing out the proto-Irish) between A.D. 380 and 400 when Magnus
Maximus was pulling out the legions.  (The garrison at Segontium--latter-day Caernarvon--was stripped in 383.)  There
is even the claim that Cunedda's grandfather was named Padarn Beisrudd, or "Paturnus of the red cloak," suggesting the
red cloak of a Roman officer.
