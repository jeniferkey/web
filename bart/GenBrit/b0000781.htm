The reach of the West Saxons was greatly extended when EDWARD won a major victory over the Danes near Tettenhall in Staffordshire in 910,
in which three kings of Northumberland were killed. (English Mercia was already essentially a province of Wessex, especially after the
death of Aethelstan, ealdorman of Mercia, after which his widow, Aethelflaeda, sister of Edward, ruled as "the Lady of the Mercians" for
eight years. When, after Ethelfleda's death in 918 and the naming by the remaining Mercian aristocracy of Ethelfleda's daughter Elfwynn as
their lady, EDWARD had Elfwynn forcibly carried off into Wessex, the last formal distinctions between Mercia and Wessex were removed.)
EDWARD died 17 JUL 924 in Farndon-on-Dee, Mercia.  His body was interred in Winchester.

whose expulsion of the Danish king of York brought English might to Scotland's doorstep. The fear of this led to the invasion in 937 by a
combined force of: Olaf, grandson of Sihtric of York, hailed as leader of the Norsemen of eastern Ireland; the king of Strathclyde; and
the king of Scotland. The battle which decisively settled English power was fought at Brunanburh, and was celebrated in a famous poem.

EDRED's reign was marked by yet another assault on Northumbria and York, first (once again) by Olaf Guthfrithson of Dublin, then by
Eric "Bloodaxe." Eric was the son of Harold "Fairhair," King of Norway; he inherited his father's throne but was ejected for his harsh
and violent rule in favor of his milder brother, Hakon (who had been fostered in the court of ATHELSTAN). Eric established himself in
York for two years. <I>The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</I> observes that Eric was driven out by the Northumbrians in 954, and then EDRED
took the Northumbrian kingdom.
EDRED died 23 NOV 955 in Frome, Somerset.  His body was interred in Winchester.  King of England 946-955.
