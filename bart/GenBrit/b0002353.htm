Friars Church, London.  King of England 1272-1307.  After subduing the Welsh March lords by taking their castles, one at a time,
Edward turned his attention to the north: Scotland.  His determination to use the confusion wrought by the untimely deaths of
Alexander III and his young daughter to gain Scotland for himself earned him the sobriquet &quot;The Hammer of the Scots&quot; for
his ruthlessness (as in the sacking of Berwick).  He also ruled firmly at home, instituting numerous legal reforms, for which he
is still considered to have been one of England's best kings.
