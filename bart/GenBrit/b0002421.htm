<A NAME="i2420"></A>She married Lionel PLANTAGENET of ANTWERP in Tower of London, 9 SEP 1342.  Lionel was born in Antwerp
29 NOV 1338.  Lionel<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP><A NAME="f239"></A><A HREF="gsourceb.htm#f239b">(239)</A></SUP></FONT> was the son of EDWARD III
PLANTAGENET and Philippa of HAINAULT.  Lionel died 17 OCT 1368 in Alba, Piedmont, at 29 years of age.   (See <A
HREF="b0002420.htm#i2420">Lionel PLANTAGENET of ANTWERP</A> for the children resulting from this marriage.)  SOURCE NOTES: _The Birth of
Britain_, Winston S. Churchill, p.242. When Elizabeth's father, the Earl of Ulster, died in 1333 without male heir, the entire inheritance
by feudal law was King Edward III's to assign at his discretion by his choice of husband for her.  After she was married to his son, Lionel
of Clarence, the leading male members of the cadet branches of the de Burgh family &quot;went Irish,&quot; grabbed what they could of Ulster, and
changed the family name to Burke.
