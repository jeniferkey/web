<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
For me, the importance of history lies in what it has to say about the
future.
<P>
Rather than being interested in history as a collection of stories about
interesting people, or as a means of criticizing humanity by cataloging
its evils, I see history as a source of practical knowledge of what
works and what doesn't.  Yes, biographies can be interesting, and yes,
the human condition deserves scrutiny.  But I think historical data
offers something more than just entertainment from yesterday or
understanding of today.  History also offers us clues--both warnings and
encouragement--describing what tomorrow may be like.
<P>
As a repository of patterns and how they change over time when acted on
by external forces, the historical record provides source data for the
development of theories of structural transformation.
</P>

<BR>
<H2>My Views</H2>

<P>
There are two questions of history in particular that interest me.  The
first asks, what works and what doesn't?
</P>

<BR>
<H3>What Works and What Doesn't?</H3>

<P>
In purely human terms, this concerns social action.  Our solitary
actions as presumably free-willed individuals add up to large-scale mass
behaviors that have significant and long-lasting effects on future
generations.  How important is any one person?  If there is a "need" for
a certain kind of person at a key moment in time, is history primarily a
record of failures to find such persons, with a few isolated instances
of the right person appearing on stage at the right time?  Or is there a
kind of "historical necessity" in which only the right <EM>kind</EM> of
person is required, who is transformed into or represented as the
specific person needed and who is simply interpreted later by historians
to have been inevitable?  Are there currents in human events, as
inexorable as the tides, which sweep up individuals and carry them off
despite their wills?  And if so, are those persons immortalized by the
historians merely the ones who, by skill or luck or both, managed to
ride the waves without sinking into obscurity?
<P>
In other words, how do particular individuals come to have profound
impacts on human patterns, and how does humanity as a whole survive such
manipulations... or the lack of them?  What works, and what doesn't?
<P>
But of course "history" is not restricted to human existence.  It would
be vain to think so, not to mention that it would create an artificial
limit to what we can learn from the natural world of which we are a
part.  (That, despite the attempts of "environmentalists" to describe
human beings as a kind of unnatural cancer on reality.)
<P>
The story of existence is a history of patterns.  Pattern is the
organization of reality according to laws governing the forms of
existence and interaction of individual elements; this is as true for
geology as it is for sociology.  The trick is to be able to pick out the
governing elements and correctly analyze the changes in their
relationships with one another--that is, to discern real patterns and to
generate acceptable explanations for the ways in which those patterns
change over time.
<P>
Non-human history offers useful lessons to someone trying to decide what
works and what doesn't.  "Forgive and forget" may be a desirable rule
for human conduct, but the rest of the natural world recognizes no such
form of preserving inefficiency and rewarding failure.  Patterns
self-organize and survive because they work.  Patterns which do not
work--that is, elements whose self-organization does not confer an
adequate survival advantage for their environment--are discarded in
favor of new patterns which are better adapted to reality.  This
transformation of patterns may take tens of thousands of years for
biological elements, or billions of years for planets, stars and
galaxies... but it will always happen, subject to the inflexible law
that, as environments change, so must their elements.
<P>
Adapt or die.  In system terms, the element that has the greatest number
of potential responses to its environment will control that environment
(see <A HREF="systems.htm">Systemantics</A>).  And the lesson for
self-aware beings like humans is this: Deal with reality.  You may not
like some aspect of reality; you may even be able to change some minor
part of reality; but what is real exists as such no matter what you
might prefer it to be.
<P>
Being a self-aware human means you have a choice.  You can choose to
remain ignorant of some aspect of reality.  You can be aware of some
aspect of reality but choose to pretend that you are unaware of it or
otherwise deny its existence as real.  Or you can act to make yourself
aware of reality and, having done so, accept what is real as real no
matter how unpleasant it may seem.
<P>
The study of history tells us which of these options is most likely to
benefit its practitioner.  Patterns which do not adapt to reality as it
changes, either because they do not, cannot, or will not perceive those
changes or because they do not, cannot or will not change themselves,
have no survival advantage.  They may last a while until some pattern
better adapted to reality comes along, but in the end, that which does
not work is replaced by that which does.
<P>
If this doesn't motivate a person to study history, I don't know what
will.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>Is History Cyclical?</H3>

<BR>
<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>
There is an old joke that history doesn't repeat itself; historians
merely repeat each other.
<P>
But of course, I'm merely repeating that joke.
<P>
The thing is, it masks what is actually an interesting question: Are
there certain patterns of human history which occur and re-occur over
time?  We are talking here about fallible humans studying the actions of
equally fallible humans.  Humans, in whom pattern-detection is bred as a
survival instinct, are capable of seeing patterns where none exist; we
may perceive patterns where there is in fact only random activity that
is unconnected by cause and effect.
<P>
But doesn't our awareness of pattern in the world around us suggest
that, if cycles of action can exist in the natural world, and we are
part of the natural world, there can be cyclical patterns in human
history as well?  And what, indeed, of cause and effect?  If we are
correct to insist that actions have consequences, that some effects can
accurately be determined to be the results of specific prior actions, then
isn't it possible that similar actions in similar environments can have
similar results, perhaps producing a repeating sequence of events?
<P>
It may not be so.  There are a lot of "ifs" here.  Perhaps human
self-awareness allows us to avoid what in the rest of the natural world
is the inevitability of particular consequences following from
particular actions; maybe free will can be defined as the ability to
break patterns.  Or perhaps too much "similarity" of environments and
actions is required to be able to assert that the "same" sequence of
events ever happens more than once (the definition of a "cycle").
<P>
The question of similarity is the key.  Time appears to be an arrow; it
moves in one direction only and actual events are never repeated.  But
if this specification of actual events is removed--if we are permitted
to classify events into categories so that we can say a particular
<EM>kind</EM> of event has occurred--then repetition becomes
possible.  The odds may be slim, depending on how narrowly one defines
one's classes of historical events, but they are not zero.  If an event
of type A is followed by an event of type B, and both types A and B
are classifications which allow multiple different events to be
considered to be meaningfully similar to one another, then it may be
possible for "A followed closely by B" to be a repeating pattern of
behavior.
<P>
In other words, history itself does not repeat, but certain sequences of
similar kinds of historical events may be perceived to repeat.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Historical Roots</H4>

<P>
So much for the theory.  What about the practice?  Whether they
<EM>can</EM> exist or not, who thinks that historical patterns actually
<EM>do</EM> occur?
<P>
It turns out that this has been a popular notion for quite a long
time.  Plato suggests that history is cyclical in his <I>Timaeus</I>
dialogue, and Vergil comes as close to stating the same thing as can be
done in poetry (his Fourth Eclogue).  (Popularity, of course, is no
guarantor of correctness, but where does one find "history" if not in
the words of historians?  One has to start somewhere.)
</P>

<P>
Three historians in particular addressed this question in the twentieth
century. They were Oswald Spengler, Arnold Toynbee, and Carroll Quigley.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Spengler</H4>
<P>
In his work, <I>The Decline of the West</I>, Oswald <A HREF="h_spengl.htm">Spengler</A>
concluded that civilizations, made of living things, have patterns of
change like living things. In particular, Spengler held that civilizations
are "born," they "mature," they "decline," and then they "die."
<P>
Spengler's work was (and remains) somewhat controversial because he was
persuaded that, just as humans and other living things have fixed lifespans,
the same is true of civilizations... which means that our own Western
civilization is as doomed to decline and death as all those that came
before us. Thus he concluded that, yes, history is cyclical; in fact, it
is fated to be so.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Toynbee</H4>
<P>
Arnold <A HREF="h_toynbe.htm">Toynbee</A>, in his extensive work <I>A Study of History</I>,
rejected Spengler's conclusion that Western civilization was doomed to
extinction. In Toynbee's view, civilizations, like human beings, are
free to chart their own courses.
<P>
This more optimistic assessment of Western civilization's chances for
survival was (not surprisingly) well-received in the West. Its more
individualistic view of history--that is, that an individual civilization
has the capacity to "consciously" choose its destiny--retained Spengler's
biological metaphor, but changed the focus from the group to the
individual. In so doing, Toynbee realized that similar low-level parts
can be connected to form many different whole things, a clue that at
some deep level, civilizations (as Spengler thought) do indeed behave
like groups of things. But Toynbee did not follow this reasoning to its
conclusion, and so was left believing that history was not cyclical,
that despite obvious similarities among them, all civilizations are free
to change as they will.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Quigley</H4>
<P>
Carroll <A HREF="h_quigle.htm">Quigley</A>, a scientist by training, could not accept either
of these views. To him, they seemed too anthropomorphic, too willing to
descibe the world in purely human terms. Better, he thought, to accept what the
facts of history actually say whether they seem humanistic or not. In
what he would call the typical Western tradition of the dialectic,
Quigley created a synthesis of Spengler and Toynbee.
<P>
According to Quigley in his work <I>The Evolution of Civilizations</I>,
civilizations--including Western civilization--are neither groups nor
individuals, but share some traits with each because each is a
<EM>system</EM>, and all systems have certain features in common. As he
penetrated deepest into what a civilization actually is, he came
closest, I think, to being able to explain how and why civilizations
change as they do. In Quigley's model, the only cyclical thing about
history is that systems come into being adapted to their environment;
the environment always changes; and those systems which cannot adapt to
the new environment will perish.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Conclusions</H4>

<BR>
<P>
Historians themselves are divided on the question of whether or not
civilizations actually follow a set path, or blaze their own unique path
each time they emerge.  For some historians, history does repeat; for
others, repetition is merely a perception, a failure to recognize that
unique individuals can be created out of identical basic elements.
<P>
And yet they all offer scripts which they claim all civilizations follow
unless interrupted.  For Spengler, this script is a play in four acts,
proceeding from overture to the ultimate and inevitable ringing down of
the curtain.  Toynbee spoke strongest against the "inevitability of
history," but still offered a script of his own.  Even Quigley offerred
a seven-stage outline of historical evolution (although his is flexible).
<P>
So it appears that, while there continues to be debate over the theory,
in practice there is agreement: civilizations do change in similar
ways.  Perhaps the only interesting question remaining is why this would
surprise anyone, given the blunt facts that civilizations do emerge, do
mature, and do perish.
<P>
My view is that Quigley's analysis of civilizations as systems comes
closest to the truth. But as he himself noted, it's difficult to study
one's own civilization objectively or completely (considering that we're
steeped in it, and it's not finished yet). So it remains to be seen which
historian's analysis of history was most correct in describing the actual
fate of our own civilization.
<P>
Will our own history repeat that of other civilizations?
<P>
Will any of us be around to find out?

the dark side of human existence.
<P>
Fukuyama, Francis -- <I>The End of History and the Last Man</I>, Avon, 1993.  The triumph of Western ways has long
been apparent to those who have refused to willingly blind themselves to reality.  This book offers a serious

"end of history": the final form of balance between the state and the individual.
<P>
Gies, Frances &amp; Joseph -- <I>Cathedral, Forge, and Waterwheel: Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages</I>,

"A Horizontal Linkage of People and Events," this book plots history as though on a graph with two axes: one of
the year, and the other of the main aspects of human life, such as science, philosophy, and daily life.  It's a
fascinating way to see what happened when.
<P>

in 1864, this book is a treasure-trove of British place-names.  Some of its etymologies have no doubt been proven
mistaken over the course of a century, but the soundness of most of them leads one down all sorts of historical and
geographical tracks.
<P>
Toynbee, Arnold J. -- <I>A Study of History, Vols. I-X</I>, as abridged by D.C. Somervell, Oxford University Press,
1987.  Toynbee's great achievement of modern historical scholarship, these books provide the empirical basis for
