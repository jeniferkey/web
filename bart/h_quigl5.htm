<H2>The Future of Western Civilization</H2>

<BR>
<H3>Elements</H3>

<P>
If you want to know where you're likely to go, you need to know three
things:
</P>

<OL>
  <LI>where you've been</LI>
  <LI>where you are now</LI>
  <LI>what pattern best fits your motion</LI>
</OL>

<P>
We've seen that third element in detail: Quigley's "seven stages." This
sequence of mixture, gestation, expansion, and conflict, followed by
either a return to expansion or a universal state and thence to decay
and invasion, is the recurring pattern Quigley observed in the
historical record.
<P>
This pattern allows us to chart the motion of civilizations through
time. To find out where Western civilization in particular may be
headed, then, we need to answer the first two questions. Where has
Western civilization been, and in which of Quigley's stages is Western
civilization now?
</P>

<BR>
<H3>Origins of Western Civilization</H3>

<I>Note: Don't be misled by this rather grandiose section heading. I'm
not going to try to explain the origins of Western civilization in vast
detail -- that would take a full book. What I'll be presenting here is a
sort of fly-by of the history of the West from a Quigleyan
perspective.</I>

<BR>
<P>
Carroll Quigley's assessment of the cultures that came together to form
Western civilization is remarkably conventional. (Perhaps this is why he
spends only one or two paragraphs on the question.) He essentially
ratifies the notion of the West as having four sources:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Classical</LI>
<LI>Semitic</LI>
<LI>Celtic</LI>
<LI>Islamic</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each of these is held to have contributed certain qualities that give
Western civilization its unique flavor. From Classical civilization the
West took its knowledge of law, government, philosophy, and science. The
enormous Semitic contribution to the West came in the form of religion
and ethics--in a word, Christianity. And although Quigley disparages its
influence somewhat, he gives a nod to the Celtic tribes of northwestern
Europe for their "social relations and technology" (to which I would add
"individualism" and "property rights"). Finally, he acknowledges the
debt of the West to the Arabic culture, which preserved and eventually
transmitted to the West what Quigley called "Classical influences," the
most important of which I believe to be legal (the legal Code distilled
by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian) and intellectual (primarily in
mathematics, especially Euclid's geometry and algebra).
<P>
These factors merged over time, modifying one another's influences. For
example, the combination of Classical law (which upheld the authority of
the state) with Celtic tribal law (eventually encoded as the "common
law" which recognized the natural rights of individual human beings)
formed a legal system that balanced the rights of the individual against
the requirements of society. Of all the unique achievements of the West,
the successful fusion of these two strong and diverse legal traditions
into a coherent code of justice must rank among the greatest.
<P>
Having granted the common understanding of the West's sources, Quigley
is then quick to point out that the fusing of these sources produced a
civilization that was entirely original in its character. Quigley
characterized the West as "optimistic, moderate, hierarchical,
democratic, individualistic yet social, and dynamic." (To which I would
only add "practical" in the same style as the Phoenicians.)
<P>
These attributes that make up Western civilization's "personality" can
be identified in the six aspects Quigley suggested for tracking a
civilization's progress over time--religious, military, political and
so on. (Though again, I prefer to highlight eight aspects, adding
ethical and technological features to a civilization's profile.) For
example, where Classical military organization began and ended as
infantry, the West's greater facility with new technology led it to
adopt mounted cavalry as its military paradigm. (This preference for
relatively small, mobile, and powerful units is still dominant in
Western civilization. Note that it emphasizes the contribution of the
individual within the group. Also, contrast it with the "lots of small,
simple, tough units" military philosophy favored by the armies of the
Warsaw Pact, which reflected aspects of Russian civilization.)
<P>
Quigley also spends considerable time explaining how Christianity
modified and accentuated the individualistic yet social nature of
Western society. He notes its optimistic organized religious philosophy
which holds that man is flawed but can be redeemed, and that the divine
must be approached in community with other persons but that souls are
entrusted to individuals. Again, as the West's legal code struck a
balance between the state and the individual, Christianity also
recognized the existence and interdependence of individual human
beings and the societies they voluntarily form. Of course, just as the
law sometimes fails to provide justice, Christianity has at times failed
to recognize that redemption is worthless if not voluntary. But again
similarly to the value of the entire Western legal code despite its
occasional lapses, the virtues of the Christian West far outweigh its
vices. Despite the Inquisition and some (perhaps most) of the Crusades,
far more citizens of the West over the last thousand years have
practiced compassion, charity, forgiveness and trust than the members
of any other religion that can be identified with a particular
civilization. On balance, Christianity contributed positively to the
success of the West.
<P>
Of at least equal importance was the West's early adoption of animal
(and, later, mechanical) power over Classical civilization's reliance on
human muscle power as an economic engine. One of the greatest advantages
the West has had over every other civilization thus far has been its
ability and willingness to increase the amount of energy readily
available to individuals. Every advance in the power of individuals to
exercise their rights seems to be tied to the amount of energy available
to any such individual at the flick of a finger. The tie may not be
perfectly direct (correlation does not imply causality), but it is
there. "Energy" may be synonymous with "power" in more ways than one.
<P>
The other traits Quigley mentions can be seen in the West as well. Taken
together, these traits of optimism, dynamism and so on are the
characteristic qualities that define Western civilization.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>The Past West</H3>

<P>
The West, according to Quigley's analysis, has had three different
instruments of expansion, each of which became institutionalized. One
was reformed, and one was circumvented, while remnants of the third
institution remain with us today as we grope toward a new instrument
of expansion.
<P>
These instruments were feudalism, commercial capitalism, and
industrial/financial capitalism.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Feudalism</H4>

<P>
The collapse of Classical (Greco-Roman) civilization provided building
material for no fewer than three other civilizations: the proto-Russian
culture to the northeast of the Mediterranean region; the Arabic culture
embracing Islam in the south; and the Christian tribes in the forests of
the northwest. (There is still debate over whether the Byzantine empire
constituted a new civilization, or whether it was the final fixed form
of Classical civilization.) The instrument of expansion for what would
become Western civilization grew out of the need to defend Christianity
from the mounted warriors of the other two neighboring young
civilizations. This early military-technological instrument of Western
expansion is known as feudalism.
<P>
As the shock weapon of the day, the only thing that could defeat a
mounted warrior was another mounted warrior. A political entity that
wanted to survive thus had to produce such fighters. We call these
mounted warriors knights, and the social, economic and political system
which permitted their creation, support, and fielding became the primary
organizing force of early Western civilization.
<P>
The trouble with knights was that they were outrageously expensive. In
addition to the obvious needs of raising, stabling, feeding and training
a knight's multiple mounts, the knight himself required constant
training and support. He also needed arms and armor, which were
expensive and eventually required special craftsmen to maintain and fit.
<P>
The high cost of maintaining knights required a large number of people
assigned to agricultural work.  (Food was the primary source of barter
material--and thus revenue--in the days preceding coinage.) The ratio of
land-workers to knights was about a hundred to one; that is, every
knight needed at least a hundred people working the land to support
him. As the knight's equipment became more complex and thus more costly,
and more persons shifted from agricultural work to non-agricultural
support roles (armorer, stableboy, quarryman, etc.), still more field
workers were necessary per knight.
<P>
Because the knight was always able to apply his power over the field
workers over the short term (even though his existence depended on
theirs over the longer term), the knights as a class were able to push
the system so that they actually took more from the agricultural class
than was needed for maintenance. Eventually this excess income became
the surplus that Quigley argues is necessary to create an instrument of
expansion.
<P>
The knights soon recognized their dependence on peasant labor. At first
this was to maintain military might, but later it became an economic
imperative as well. In early feudalism, knights took the direct
approach: workers were not permitted to stray from the lands they
worked. As this form of restraint spread geographically and survived
over time, it was formalized; first as tradition, then as "legal" rules
binding the peasants to the land they worked in exchange for protection
and justice provided by the master of those lands. The agricultural
workers became what we call "serfs."
<P>
Thus, the knight existed to protect the serfs, and the serfs existed to
support the knight. Over time, this protective role of the knight became
progressively finer-grained. What began as defending one's serfs against
heathen invaders became defending them against other knights, and
finally to defending individual serfs from one another.
<P>
(Note that relics of this migration of the defense function from the
group to the individual, from the military realm to the legal, remain
with us to this day. Consider how the personification of "Justice" is
often artistically represented holding a sword. Another example is the
use of the term "Esq." or "esquire" among modern lawyers. The term was
used in feudal times to refer to a knight's shield-bearer, who aspired
to knighthood himself. Such a person was expected to "earn his spurs" of
knighthood by traveling his lord's lands, upholding justice in his
lord's name.)
<P>
As the threat of external invasion faded, the process of internal
consolidation of control intensified. Knights turned more toward
fighting each other, sometimes to establish dominance, sometimes simply
for plunder.
<P>
Groups of knights began to organize in the fundamental military
organization, the hierarchy. A lone knight or one with hostile neighbors
might swear to support a more powerful knight in return for that greater
knight's protection. Eventually this relationship, like that of the
knight to his serfs, became formalized as lord to vassal. The land
(called the "fee") owned by a lord was assigned to a vassal in return
for that vassal's support, either in direct military assistance or,
particularly in the late feudal period, money in lieu of military
service (a bargain called "scutage"). A lesser knight might have a
handful of vassals, while a powerful knight might attract many strong
knights with vassals of their own. It is this formal organization of
lords and vassals defined by property rights and legal obligations of
service, supported by a much more numerous second class of persons
required to provide economic support, which is properly recognized as
"feudalism."
<P>
The feudal system allowed the young Western civilization to survive and
grow in two ways. First, it backed the military system that protected
its rough geopolitical borders. Second, it was productive enough to
permit some to accumulate surpluses. These effects allowed feudalism to
survive to become an instrument of expansion.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Feudalism to Municipal Mercantilism</H4>

<P>
The agricultural support aspect of feudalism took the form of tracts of
land whose output (crops, game, wood, stone, etc.) was collected at a
manor house for storage and distribution. With the passage of time, more
and more vassals began to provide these collected manorial surpluses to
their feudal lords in place of military service. But increasing
population and agricultural improvements meant that even after payments
to one's lord there were surpluses remaining. These surpluses could be
applied to general improvements, but they also allowed personal spending
on non-essential goods.
<P>
And so commerce was reborn. Where it had languished after the collapse
of Mediterranean-based Classical civilization, trade became possible
again to acquire luxury items from distant lands. The surplus wealth
accumulated over the years by powerful families of knights was invested
in voyages of exploration and the opening of trade routes both by sea
around the Spanish coast and by land through Alpine passes. Local
economies trading among themselves sprang up to specialize in various
products, from cheeses in good pasture lands, to wines from the hills,
to grains from open fields.
<P>
As commerce began to flourish, commercial centers began to form around
some of the most successful manors. Some became villages, some towns,
and some--those in particularly good trade locations or positions of
military defense value--prospered enough to attract so many people as to
become cities. This increase in economic opportunity freed some
individuals from general agricultural labor and allowed them to take up
more specialized trades. This produced more goods for trade, which in
turn added to the general prosperity.
<P>
This acceleration of economic and other aspects of Western civilization
reached its peak in the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries, which
Quigley marks as an Age of Expansion for the West. During this time,
improvements in one aspect enabled advances in others. More travel led
to enhanced trade; trade needed military protection; armed forces made
use of technological improvements; new technologies sprang from the
increased exchange of scientific knowledge; new knowledge raised new
ethical questions answered by revisions and expansions of Christian
belief; differences of belief promoted the establishment of standard
legal codes and the creation of political entities which became nations;
and nations profited by increased trade.
<P>
This feudal trade in goods was so widespread and so brisk that all other
aspects of Western civilization were pulled forward. As an example of
how far an individual could travel, consider the case of Harald Fairhair
of Norway. Born into one of Norway's ruling houses, he fled his home in
the early 11th century, traveling nearly the length of Europe to join
the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople (today's
Istanbul, Turkey). Later Harald returned to Norway to become king,
ultimately contending against his cousin Harold and the Norman duke
William for the English throne in 1066. His travels and exploits would
have been nearly unthinkable in the static and arrogant Classical
civilization; only the dynamic and capitalistic Western civilization
offered an individual such opportunities.
<P>
It couldn't last, of course.
<P>
Feudalism, like all instruments of expansion, eventually became
institutionalized. The primary cause of this was the transition from
what was essentially a barter economy to a money economy.
<P>
By 1274--the year in which Thomas Aquinas died and Edward I was crowned
King of England--the military-oriented feudal hierarchy had condensed
and solidified into a political and economic hierarchy referred to as
"chivalry." Over time, as coinage was introduced and became widespread,
the old obligation of vassals and serfs to pay in kind through service
had been replaced by payment in money. Military service was now
entrusted to professional soldiers: royal and ducal guards and
mercenaries, all of whom rendered their military service in return for
pay. This placed financial pressure on ambitious lords. With their
numbers now essentially fixed according to territory, the princes began
to compete among themselves for limited resources, rather than expanding
into new areas of trade that benefitted everyone even if some did better
than others.
<P>
The money being pumped into the system from years of brisk trade began
to exceed the quantity of goods available for purchase. As always
happens when the supply of money exceeds what can be bought with that
money, prices rose. The new commercial classes, feeling their profits
shrinking as high prices reduced sales, began enacting laws to try to
protect those profits. But in doing so, they accelerated the the erosion
of those profits by shrinking the overall rate of investment in new
trade.
<P>
The Hanseatic League is one of the better-known examples of this. At
first an organization of merchants in some German cities, it later came
to be represented by cities themselves, whose goal was to take an active
role in protecting their trade profits. (Thus the name "municipal
mercantilism.") In addition to combating Danish piracy and promoting
trade routes, the League established numerous policies intended to
restrict trade. It instituted tariffs on goods passing through its
hands, capped the output of goods produced, prevented entry of new
workers into protected industries, restricted buying and selling in town
markets, and raised prices. In short, the Hanseatic League practiced
what we today would call "protectionism," and other merchant guilds were
quick to follow suit to protect their own profits. The effect of this
municipal mercantilism was to further discourage investment in new
trade. It was not long until the West's first Age of Expansion
collapsed into an Age of Conflict.
<P>
The West began to display the widespread economic tumult that is one of
the typical indicators of an Age of Conflict once the supply of
easily-mined gold and silver bullion began to run out. With less money
available to buy goods, demand declined, and prices fell as a result. As
prices fell while wages and the cost of producing goods remained high,
profit margins shrank. To try to prop up prices, production of goods was
curtailed, even to the point of burning crops.
<P>
A time of scarcity ensued, made far worse with the onset in 1348 of the
years of the Black Plague. With failure and death everywhere, rulers
turned to conscripting peasants into armies of foreign conquest... if
only to avoid letting them spontaneously form armies of revolution. The
next two centuries featured nearly continual inter- and intra-national
warfare. The Hundred Years War, the War of the Roses, English against
Scots and Welsh, Germans against French, French against Burgundians, and
the machinations of the Italian "princes of the Church"--these were all
products of a civilization turned from outward expansion to the inward
consolidation that marks an Age of Conflict.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Commercial Capitalism to State Mercantilism</H4>

<P>
Municipal mercantilism was reformed near the middle of the fifteenth
century by a new economic system: commercial capitalism. This new system
for the accumulation of economic surplus was also a circumvention of the
old feudal system, as the armed power of the feudal lords was superseded
by the political power of dynastic monarchies.
<P>
By the mid-1400s, Europe had begun to settle down from the political,
economic and medical upheavals of the previous three centuries. In a
remarkably short time, stability at home led to a renewed interest in
the outside world. The West, collectively, began looking once more
beyond its own shores. The resumption of exploration opened up new
frontiers for settlement and exploitation, and these expansive impulses
carried over into dramatic advances in knowledge and widespread trade.
<P>
So great was the improvement in the West's outlook and conditions that
we today recognize this period of rebirth with the term "Renaissance."
<P>
The instrument of expansion that made this revitalization possible was
capitalism. In this early form the concept of private property (from the
West's wild Celtic ancestors) first came to be defended by the armed
power of the new political-legal form of monarchical states. "Citizens"
swore allegiance to the King as the state, and the state in turn
recognized the right of individuals to their own property. As the right
of individuals to own things was thus strengthened by law, it became
possible for individuals--not just the relatively few lords and guild
members--to trade for profit. This voluntary exchange of capital goods
over a market-based price system is what we refer to as "capitalism,"
and it changed the world.
<P>
The great advantage this socio-economic mode has over other forms of
resource transfer is its efficiency. Under capitalism, profit is not
guaranteed--making money entails risk. This risk, borne by anyone who
engages in capital transfer or creation, ensures that only those
transactions advantageous to the most persons are undertaken. In other
words, when your own resources are at risk, you have more incentive than
anyone else to make sure that those resources are used in the most
productive way possible. This risk factor therefore encourages people
to make more carefully considered investment decisions than they might
otherwise have done, increasing the overall effectiveness of the entire
system. As other economic systems impose costs derived from trying to
minimize or even eliminate this risk, they in fact decrease the
efficiency of the whole system by lowering the cost of making bad
investment decisions. As a result, capitalism winds up being the most
efficient at directing resources to the widest advantage.
<P>
This efficiency of commercial capitalism encouraged everyone to trust
in the system enough to take part. As more individuals and groups
participated in the system (because they realized that the laws now
protected their right to profit), the productivity of the entire society
increased, attaining previously unreachable heights. One readily visible
indicator of this is the geographical expansion of Western civilization
during the period in question (from roughly 1450 to 1700 in what by the
latter date had become the core region of the West). Maps which at the
start of this period showed an area not much larger than that spanned by
Classical civilization at its height had grown by the end of the
Renaissance to nearly complete and relatively accurate maps of the
entire Earth. This information exactly tracked the spread of Western
influence and knowledge.
<P>
(Some reading this section may be wondering whether I intend to "admit"
that this expansion of Western influence came at the cost of destroying
numerous indigenous cultures, particularly throughout North and South
America. Did this happen? Yes. Having said so, there are two ways of
studying this effect--one being the objective, non-judgemental approach
taken by Quigley, and the other being the subjective "good guys and bad
guys" evaluation so popular today. This review of Quigley's work follows
his preference for sticking to the description of evidence; for a study
of whether the assimilation of younger or less dynamic cultures by
Western civilization was "good" or "bad" for humanity on this planet
overall, the reader is referred to Dr. Thomas Sowell's excellent book
<I>Conquests and Cultures</I>.)
<P>
By the end of this time, however, the Western monarchies, their
transformation into our modern national states well under way, had begun
to shift from attempting to dominate one another by force to a focus on
commercial superiority. Since this early form of capitalism was based on
profiting by the exchange of goods and services (as distinct from the
productivity-based capitalism to come), its institutionalized form
consisted of gradually increasing restrictions on capital exchange.
<P>
The primary form of this was in national transport laws. To protect
their now far-flung commercial interests, national states enacted laws
requiring goods to flow through their own territories so that excise
taxes could be collected. This acted as a brake on the exchange of
goods; and once begun, led to the further institutionalization of
commercial capitalism into "state mercantilism."
<P>
Exploration slowed. Religious fevers spread by the various descendants
of Martin Luther shook all of Europe. Knowledge still increased, but at
nothing like the heady rate up to the time of Newton. The West entered
another phase of consolidation, this time devoted to understanding and
exploiting the discoveries of the Renaissance period. Technological
progress slowed, as the introduction of new mechanical tools into
industry was so highly regulated (via "craft codes" and other rules) to
protect existing work that productivity languished for decades. New
tariffs, such as England's notorious Stamp Act, were enacted by the
dozens, leading to a ripple effect as other nations followed suit in
retribution.
<P>
As is usually the case during such times, militarism increased to
protect resources now perceived as scarce. States contended with one
another both on the Continent and through their new territorial
proxies. From perhaps 1688 (when the last Catholic king of England was
deposed and replaced with Dutch and German princes) to 1815 (when
Napoleon's consolidating ambitions were shattered at Waterloo), the
European nations that constituted the West were almost constantly at
war with one another; sometimes here, sometimes there, but always
scrabbling at each other to claim what they thought were the last
pieces of territorial pie.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Industrial/Financial Capitalism to Monopoly Capitalism</H4>

<P>
Literacy having taken hold in the West as nowhere else, the intellectual
aspect of Western civilization recovered from the institutionalization
of commercial capitalism before other aspects. The first harbinger of
the circumvention of state mercantilism was the intellectual period now
known as the Enlightenment.
<P>
During this time new ideas forced their way into the public
consciousness through the new media of the press and inexpensive books
and magazines. Once information could flow freely among people, it did
so. Thus, Adam Smith in Scotland could read statistical abstracts of
industrial stagnation in France and elsewhere, and from them deduce the
principles of free-market capitalism that were to ignite a global
economic revolution. (Nor was his work primarily economic. Smith's
primary work was ethical; he lectured at the University of Glasgow as
Professor of Moral Philosophy.) Likewise, James Watt could be inspired
by the engineering concepts of which he'd read to invent a better way to
pump water out of mine shafts: a steam engine in which the cool
condenser was separated from the hot steam-filled cylinder. This one
design change increased pump efficiency so much that Watt's engine could
supply power to applications never before possible--such as pulling
wheeled vehicles over railway tracks or even dirt roads.
<P>
This new confluence of intellectual and technological concepts laid the
foundation for the bursts of invention that characterize the 1800s in
the West. And as Quigley observes, this inventiveness increased human
productivity sufficiently to form a new instrument for the accumulation
of surplus. We call it the Industrial Revolution.
<P>
The first stage of this change was dramatic enough to receive its own
designation: the Agricultural Revolution. During this time, human and
animal power were replaced by the vastly more productive mechanical
power. Along with new methods of planting and grazing that finally
replaced the ancient "three-field" system, the new tools both increased
yields and made harvesting those yields considerably more efficient, so
that more could be done with less stock and fewer workers.
<P>
As was the case when the introduction of animal power freed human beings
to engage in non-agricultural work, displaced agricultural workers moved
into the cities. The increased social contacts here further accelerated
the interplay and generation of new ideas.  This also led, however, to
an increased spread of disease. In direct response to this condition,
medicine was revolutionized by applying the new scientific principles to
discovering the true causes of disease. The twin discoveries of vaccines
and sterilization (not to mention sanitation) began saving lives
immediately. A higher birthrate due to more and better food, together
with lengthened lifespans due to medical science, produced a population
boom that gave the West (as Julian Simon noted) millions more persons
able to contribute their individual productivity to the economic
progress of the entire society.
<P>
Exploration resumed, this time into the still relatively unknown reaches
of Africa and North and South America. Intended primarily to claim new
resources by settlement, this geographic expansion also relieved some
population pressures. (Deportation of unwanted individuals increased,
too.)
<P>
With food supplies assured, the religious schisms largely calmed, and a
fresh burst of scientific and ethical reasoning driving innovation, the
1800s saw a period of technological progress never equaled before or
since. As quickly as a new scientific principle could be deduced and
written down, engineers built machines to employ that principle in any
way possible.
<P>
The application of the new technologies to industry was immediate and
unstoppable, and arrived in such great force as to create a new
instrument of expansion. This new instrument, like its predecessor, was
capitalism. But the new capitalism was based not on the exchange of
goods for money but on the production of goods. As steam power became
widely used (especially by the railroads), the distribution of raw
materials to manufacturers and manufactured goods to consumers opened up
vast new opportunities for commerce. Suddenly, virtually anyone with
access to raw materials had the potential to become a manufacturer.
<P>
The West thus had in place: legal protection for personal property
rights (from Celtic tradition); an efficient new means of distributing
resources and goods among producers and consumers (from technology);
and many new consumers (from advances in agriculture and medicine). Only
one factor remained to be developed to allow the new production-based
capitalism to become a new instrument of expansion: the transformation
of money from physical wealth to intangible value.
<P>
This final social invention necessary to spur a new age of expansion was
born in the reformation of banking. In order to expand so as to increase
production, industries needed money, and lots of it. One key to
obtaining that financing was what became known as the "fractional
reserve" system of banking.
<P>
Until 1694 and the establishment of the Bank of England, monetary
payment for goods was generally in specie (the variously-denominated
gold and silver coins of the realm). The Bank of England, however,
established the principle that notes promising payment underwritten by
the bank--banknotes--were "as good as cash," but needed to be backed by
bank specie reserves to only a fraction of their face value. This meant
that the rest of the value of the note was available for other
purposes. As other banks quickly followed suit, vast sums of money were
freed for investment in new capital by bank loans.
<P>
By 1800 this radical concept of "fractional-reserve banking," combined
with the new economic ideas of Smith and Ricardo (again, these were
actually ethical theories describing how best to increase the common
social good) was at war--literally--with the older bullion and
specie-based economy of Napoleon's France, which was now part of the
conservative core region of the West. As Quigley points out is often the
case, by the time of an age of conflict the innovation that moves a
civilization forward tends to come from the periphery of a
civilization's geographical extent, rather than from its more settled
core. Not only was this the case when peripheral Britain eclipsed core
France to become during the nineteenth century a globe-spanning empire
"on which the sun never set," it also accurately describes Britain's own
subsumption into the European core in the 20th century as the peripheral
United States exceeded all other competing Western entities, giving rise
to the description of the 1900s as the "American Century."
<P>
(The obvious question at this point is: If the 20th century was
American, whose stamp will be on the 21st century? Keep reading....)
<P>
As with all other instruments, this banking-based "industrial/financial
capitalism" slowly became an institution preserved by the elite who most
benefited from it. These were primarily the financial wizards of Wall
Street, investment bankers who, due to their ability to raise large
amounts of public capital, could seat themselves as directors on the
boards of the largest and most profitable corporations. This was
possible because of the development of the corporation--a business that
was owned by public individuals (shareholders) but managed by financial
professionals for its owners. This economic innovation succeeded (as it
does to this day) because it allowed the great mass of citizens to
participate. If you had money to invest, and did so prudently, you could
profit as the company in which you invested profited and returned some
of its gains to you as a reward for your sound investment. The
efficiency of this system (as observed previously) was maintained by the
risk factor--the fact that a poorly-managed company could cause an
investor to lose money had the dual effect of promoting both prudent
investment and conservative business management.
<P>
This produced a synergy: as the economy expanded by industrial growth
fed by public participation, the public standard of living improved; as
the public's economic condition improved, there was more money to invest
in new capital to keep the expansion going. The fact that the "captains
of industry" profited more than others does not in any way negate the
fact that millions of people materially improved their lives far more
rapidly than they otherwise could have done. (As, in fact, individuals
living in social systems unlike Western civilization could not and did
not do.)
<P>
Nevertheless, there was (as there always is) pressure from those at the
top of this process to eliminate any change in it. This pressure led
inevitably to the institutionalization of this industrial/financial
capitalism. In this case, the favored control mechanism was monetary
policy (the policy which determines the amount and "velocity" of money
in a financial system, which controls the value of that money and thus
the overall health of an economy). While the industrialists favored a
monetary policy of low interest rates and a large money supply (so that
consumers had plenty of money with which to buy industrial products
and invest in new capital), the great financiers--who because they
controlled investment banks controlled monetary policy--preferred to
keep interest rates high and the supply of money limited by tying it to
known, on-hand reserves of gold (the "gold standard"). Since the supply
of gold always increased more slowly than industrial output (except
during certain brief periods when new sources of gold were discovered,
as in the Klondike and South Africa), every unit of money tied to that
gold supply slowly became worth more over time.
<P>
This policy of keeping the value of money artificially high, which
prevailed until the Great Depression, worked to the advantage of the
financiers. The higher the value of money used in financial
transactions, the greater the real profits of those who can engage in
such transactions.
<P>
The problem with this policy is not that the financiers benefited
disproportionately compared to industrialists or to workers. They did,
but it should be noted that the average citizen also did better over
time than citizens working in other economic systems. The fact that a
few persons did <EM>much</EM> better should not obscure the real
economic advances made by society in general. Despite the beliefs of
well-meaning idealists who rely on incomplete static analyses and faulty
zero-sum assumptions, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with an
economic policy that produces large gains by a few persons as long as
most other persons affected by that policy see real--even if
smaller--gains of their own. A rising tide does not lift all boats
equally; trying to force such equality of economic outcomes may sound
enlightened but will in fact prevent the lifting of boats at
all. General prosperity actually requires limited megaprosperity.
<P>
To put this in Quigleyan terms, any instrument of expansion requires
that some individuals be able to accumulate an "unneeded" surplus. The
economic policy of keeping the value of money artificially high achieved
this end by benefiting the financiers who controlled it.
<P>
No economic policy is completely positive, however. In this case, the
problem with maintaining a high value of money relative to the goods
which can be purchased by that money (a condition known as "deflation")
is the suppression of productivity. If money is too scarce or too
valuable for consumers to purchase goods, causing them to reduce their
demand for goods, producers have less incentive to create those goods
because what consumers are willing to pay is less likely to cover the
costs of production plus profits. In a capitalist market economy, less
profit means less production.
<P>
(A similar effect on productivity is produced by the more common
condition known as "inflation." Under inflation, money becomes worth
less over time--that is, a fixed amount of money can buy less of the
same good. When this happens, consumer demand remains strong but
consumers don't have enough money to afford the goods they want. So
while deflation reduces the external demand for goods, inflation raises
the internal cost of producing goods. As both of these diminish profits,
both suppress productivity. The persistence of either condition is thus
mostly bad news for a national economy, which is why economists and
investors are so sensitive to hints that either condition is growing.)
<P>
This deflationary pattern continued for decades, with productivity
falling further and further behind what the West was capable of
consuming. To survive in this economic environment, to maintain livable
profits, producers had to reduce costs. This was achieved by creating
more efficient production processes. (This increased efficiency is one
of the positive effects of deflation.) Companies could also merge with
one another to try to achieve efficient management--separate producers
of parts of a complete product would merge to offer the whole product
with less administrative duplication, lowering costs.
<P>
Such consolidation left corporations mostly alive, but the price of
being bigger was ponderousness, arrogance, and a general inability to
adapt to changing conditions. By the late 1920s a handful of giant
corporations, whose capital value was tied to the international gold
standard being used to keep the value of money high, controlled a vast
swath of the entire Western economic system. The instrument of expansion
that was industrial/financial capitalism had petrified into the
institution Quigley calls "monopoly capitalism."
<P>
One of the effects of the monopolization of the Western economic system
was price inflation due to decreased competition. Since consolidation
meant fewer companies in the same business, the external pressure to
maintain profits by reducing costs was lifted. As monopolies, companies
could simply raise prices. This--and not "hard times" or "social
unrest"--is the real reason why the unionization of labor, which had
been prevented by management for many years, was finally allowed to
occur. Since the wage increases that are the point of unionization could
be absorbed by a large corporation though monopolistic price increases,
by the middle of this century union membership was at an all-time
high. Given the shrinking cost of wages as a percentage of
capitalization, and the associated higher cost of idle production lines
due to strikes, management found it convenient to "give in" to
unionization. Besides, higher wages (the reasoning went) would mean more
money available to consumers to buy the increasingly expensive (though
decreasingly innovative) products of monopoly capitalism. As the
monopolist Henry Ford famously commented, "They can have any color [car]
they want, as long as it's black."
<P>
The observation by a GM chairman in testimony to the United States
Congress that "What's good for GM is good for America" was no more
than a recognition of reality. So much of the Western economy was bound
to the fortunes of GM and the other monopolies that what happened to
them was bound to have an powerful effect on all those who depended on
that economy.
<P>
By the time the Panic of 1929 paralyzed investment, shattering
confidence in business and thus further restraining productivity, the
ensuing Great Depression was inevitable. If the West was to avoid
petrifying into a Universal State and thence progressing to eventual
destruction, monopoly capitalism would have to be reformed or
circumvented. The Great Depression forced that choice.
<P>
It should however be noted that, like other Ages of Conflict, this
third such period in the history of Western civilization manifested in
more aspects than the purely economic. Quigley points out, for example,
that while the prior Age of Conflict was fought with expensive weapons
employed by expensive specialists (mercenaries), so that power tended to
concentrate in the hands of a few wealthy monarchs, the development of
mass production made possible cheap and powerful weapons usable by
anyone. From this devolution of power to the masses Quigley deduces the
transformation of authoritarian monarchies into the democratic national
states of our century.
<P>
By 1900 onward, however, the tools of force once again started to become
more complex and expensive: artillery, tanks, jets, The Bomb. National
states, which were the only entities that could afford both to produce
such weapons and to train and field men to employ them, began contending
among themselves rather than exploring. The Boer War, the
Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II... virtually all were wars
rising out of the impulses toward imperialist expansion that typify an
Age of Conflict. (Note, however, that most of these conflicts originated
in the core states of the West, rather than from the periphery.)
<P>
During the most recent Age of Conflict capitalism hardened from a
productive instrument of economic expansion into a protective
institution of class oppression, in which workers were pitted against
the owners of capital. Likewise, the devolution of power due to cheap
weapons that fostered the instrument of democracy was reversed by more
specialized weaponry, leading to an institution of imperialist
expansion. Another of the signs of an Age of Conflict was the changing
of the instrument of intellectual expansion during the Enlightenment
into an institution of irrationality in which reason was subordinated to
sensation.
<P>
During a period of irrationality, if certain facts dispute comfortable
social theory or pleasant feelings, then those facts must be ignored,
suppressed, or ridiculed into silence. There are all too many examples
of such deliberate rejection of careful, honest thought in the most
recent Age of Conflict. Marx's social theory was applied without regard
to economic virtue or ethical value; Freud was sufficiently plausible to
eventually dominate all psychological thought; Margaret Sanger's
marketing of eugenics to destroy undesirable human lives was embraced
by Adolph Hitler as "scientific" support for his belief in Aryan racial
supremacy; Lyndon Johnson promoted a "Great Society" to end poverty by
appropriating the wealth of the surplus-creating class (while his
MacNamara-led analysts in the Pentagon consistently ignored military
necessity in Vietnam); drinking, drugs and gambling became widespread;
the academy succumbed to intellectual nihilism and defensiveness
("deconstructionism" and Political Correctness); in short, the latest
Age of Conflict was marked in its intellectual aspect by the ascendancy
of feeling over thought and wishes over reality.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>The Present West</H3>

<P>
<I>The Evolution of Civilizations</I> was first published in 1961. The
observations and ideas Quigley proposed were thus current up to the late
1950s, and reflect the relatively short amount of time elapsed since the
the institutionalization of financial capitalism into monopoly
capitalism. When Quigley wrote, it was too soon to know if Western
society would be able to reform or circumvent its institution of
expansion (monopoly capitalism), or whether new institutions of class
oppression, imperialist expansion, and irrationality would prove so
powerful as to allow the West to become a Universal State on its way to
decay and invasion.
<P>
It still may be too early to tell. But some of the events and trends
since Quigley's day can be added to those he perceived. So what
civilization-defining events have taken place since then? Let's first
look at what's been most important to Western civilization--the economic
aspect. (Technology got us here, but capitalism has had a broader
effect.)
<P>
Quigley points out that in a modern economy there are three chief
claimants to economic resources: consumption, capital accumulation, and
government services (including defense). Before financial capitalism
turned into monopoly capitalism (by the early 1930s), the emphasis on
accumulating capital favored by financiers had far outweighed the other
two uses.
<P>
By the time Quigley wrote his "introduction to historical analysis,"
however, consumption had become the leading user of resources, at the
expense (as Quigley saw it) of savings and public services. Although
government spending had spiked massively in the 1930s, and with defense
spending in the 1940s took the majority of national wealth, this was an
atypical period that by 1960 had resolved into the consumption-led
economic organization Quigley perceived.
<P>
But the demand-side theories of John Maynard Keynes would not be easily
extracted from Western economic policy-making. (Roughly stated, Keynes
held that economic progress needed to be led by government spending to
"prime the pump." The idea was that, as spending on public works created
new capital and moved money back to consumers through wages, this would
spur general economic activity.) Although public consumption of economic
resources had arguably by 1960 overtaken savings as a primary use,
government spending had not stopped its steady increase. Once the
precedent was set that centralized legislators and bureaucrats knew
better than states and individuals where economic resources were needed,
it was only natural that the central authorities would retain their hold
on economic power.
<P>
This is most easily seen in the core European states, whose parliaments
combine both the legislative and executive powers. Able to both compel
and direct government spending of public economic resources, tax rates
in these countries rose dramatically. Sweden, for example, eventually
raised its highest income tax rate to 98 percent. Neighboring states
followed close behind, and even the peripheral United States, with its
separate legislative and executive powers, had by the late 1970s a top
marginal income tax rate of 78 percent. Once government spending starts,
it seems, convincing the central authorities to relax their grip on the
national pursestrings becomes increasingly difficult.
<P>
But "difficult" is not necessarily "impossible." Although the Keynesian
influence in U.S. economic policy could still be discerned as late as
A.D. 2000 in "targeted tax cut" proposals, it suffered a serious blow in
the early 1980s. Between the "supply-side" tax cuts in the U.S. and
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's sweeping privatization of Britain's
sclerotic industries, the West found that economic growth could be
achieved without high inflation. For example, although by 1986 the U.S.
under President Ronald Reagan had cut its top income tax rate to 28
percent, the massive economic trauma predicted by Keynesian theorists
never materialized.
<P>
Instead, by the year 2000 the West had enjoyed almost two decades of
nearly continuous economic progress. Despite brief recessionary periods
and higher rates of unemployment in the more socialistic Western
nations, Western civilization generally appeared to be prospering
economically. Was it possible that the West's Age of Conflict was over?
<P>
If so, in which of Quigley's seven stages is Western civilization
now? Has the West been rejuvenated by a new Age of Expansion? Or is its
apparent success the overripe glow of a Universal State on its way to
decline and absorption by some younger and more vital civilization?
</P>

<BR>
<H3>The Future West</H3>

<P>
An Age of Conflict is a decision point. In all the cases Quigley
examined, a civilization in Stage 4 always changes to either Stage 3 or
Stage 5. That is, a civilization in an Age of Conflict always either
returns to an Age of Expansion (if that civilization's institution of
expansion is reformed or circumvented into a new working instrument of
expansion), or else it becomes a Universal State (if an energetic but
institutionalized society is able to gain control over the entire
civilization).
<P>
So, if the West has finally exited its latest Age of Conflict, in what
stage is it now? Has monopoly capitalism been reformed or circumvented
by some new instrument of expansion, allowing the West to enjoy an
unprecedented fourth Age of Expansion? Or have the instruments of class
oppression, imperialist expansion, and irrationality proven too strong
to reform or circumvent, leading the West to become a Universal State
(probably controlled by the most active peripheral state, the United
States)?
<P>
One of Quigley's remarkable accomplishments was his development of a
model--his "seven stages"--that takes into account both Spengler and
Toynbee. Spengler looked at non-western civilizations and perceived that
they proceed from an Age of Conflict to a Universal State and thence to
destruction. Toynbee focused on the West, and observed that it always
managed to reform itself, returning from an Age of Conflict back to an
Age of Expansion. In their limited perceptions, both Spengler and
Toynbee might be right... but Quigley's more encompassing theory of how
civilizations change reveals that the West, like all other civilizations
gone before, has a choice. Neither decline nor rebirth is assured.
<P>
But although we have Quigley's model to consult, we remain without an
answer to the question: Where are we now? Was Spengler right, and are we
now seeing "the decline of the West?" Or was Toynbee's instinct correct,
and the West has once again revived itself?
</P>

<H4>Future West (Stage 5)</H4>

<P>
Let's assume that Spengler was right. If Western civilization has become
a Universal State, it should be possible to identify the instruments of
class oppression, imperialist expansion, and irrationality that have
triumphed.
<P>
A good case could probably be made for our Hollywoodized "entertainment
culture" being an instrument of irrationality. But we should probably
skip this aspect as being too subjective a determination to make
ourselves--every age appears more irrational than the one preceding
it.
<P>
Imperialist expansion? The evidence for this one is mixed. The West
since Quigley's day has fielded troops in Vietnam, Grenada, the
Falklands, Panama, the Arabian (Persian) Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, and
Bosnia. Yet these conflicts, to which the West brought massively
superior firepower, resulted in no territorial gains for the West. To
the contrary, there are examples of a Western retreat from its outlying
provinces, Hong Kong and the Panama Canal being the two most notable
examples. On balance, it does not appear that Western civilization is
controlled in part by an instrument of imperialist expansion. (There is
a question of cultural expansion, and certainly democracy spread
throughout much of the world during the 1980s. But these effects were
not imposed on nations by imperialist design; rather, they have been
voluntarily adopted.)
<P>
As for evidence of an instrument of class oppression... it would seem
that the trend has been in precisely the opposite direction. Compared to
citizens of other civilizations, Westerners are astonishingly free to
improve their lives, to rise above their beginnings to the pinnacles of
success. Perhaps the only question of "class" remaining is the so-called
"digital divide"--those who have Internet-linked computers and those who
do not. But without dismissing this argument too glibly, it should be
noted that computing and internetworking technologies continue to leap
forward, with a correspondingly swift and continual decline in the cost
of going on-line. If there is a question here of "class" distinction, it
is one without oppression (who is preventing anyone from owning a
computer?) that is changing for the better.
<P>
Still, let us suppose for argument's sake that the West has indeed gone
the way of Rome, and atrophied into a Universal State. What then? If so,
the most interesting question is: What younger civilization is most
likely to rise from the ashes of the West? Quigley offers some clues.
<P>
The table below summarizes Quigley's impression of the stages of the
world's most important civilizations and their likely progress over
time.

<P>
But this table was created in Quigley's day. Let us assume that we have
moved on to the next series of stages, that the West has been engulfed
by the United States to form a Universal State, and that the Russian
civilization entered an Age of Conflict signified in part by the
toppling of the Soviet Union in 1989. The table then becomes:

<P>
Looking at this chart, it would seem that, by the time (in the
relatively near future) that the West has weakened to the point of being
in Decay (Stage 6), Russian civilization may have proceeded to its own
Universal Empire (Stage 5). In this case it will likely be too
preoccupied with its own internal problems (establishing dominance from
a peripheral region over the core) to pose a threat to even an enfeebled
West. If, however, Russia emerges from what appears to be its current
Age of Conflict with a new instrument of expansion, it would re-enter
Stage 3, and be a strong contender for absorbing the West--probably
remaining content with the European states.
<P>
The rest of the West--namely, the U.S.--might have a different fate. As
the chart notes, it is possible that the new Chinese civilization
Quigley envisioned as developing would have reached its own Age of
Expansion in the near future. In this case, an East-looking China might
decide to give its billions of citizens some <I>lebensraum</I> by
encouraging them to acquire fragments of Western civilization directly
from their previous owners.
<P>
I consider this scenario unlikely, however. For one thing, it is simply
not that easy to move billions of people. For another, Quigley's chart
suggests that an expansive Chinese civilization might have a more local
problem to contend with, that being a new Indian civilization entering
Age of Conflict. As one of the hallmarks of this period is an increase
in imperialist conflicts (over territory of one kind or another),
Chinese and Indian civilizations could easily find themselves in the
same kind of proxy-fought Cold War as Western and Russian civilizations
experienced through most of the twentieth century.
<P>
Finally, although Quigley does not discuss it or describe it in his
chart, it seems to me much more likely that, if the U.S. part of the
West is to be absorbed once it passes through a period of Decay into a
time of Invasion, its most likely inheritor will be a Central or South
American super-state. Not only would such a state find it considerably
easier to migrate physically into its new northern territory, but a new
South American civilization would seem to have more to gain than any
other civilization by such an infusion of the best aspects of the
moribund Western civilization. Imagine the impact of democracy and
capitalism on a young and dynamic civilization that lacks stability...
then think about the news reports of Hispanic immigration to the U.S....
and, finally, consider think-tank projections that the Hispanic
population of the U.S. could achieve a majority by mid-century.
<P>
I'm not suggesting that the U.S. is "under assault" by Hispanic
immigration, or reaching any other such subjective and even pejorative
conclusion. What I am doing is pointing out the apparent similarity
between the movement of peoples during previous times of Mixture (such
as that of the Indo-Europeans and the Canaanites) and the current
migration of South and Central Americans northward. It is not at all
certain that this modern migration is the prelude to the demise of the
peripheral West--but the possibility is fascinating.
</P>

<H4>Future West (Stage 3)</H4>

<P>
But suppose all this has been too pessimistic. Maybe the West hasn't
petrified into a moribund Universal State after all. Let's consider the
possibility that the West has been able to reinvigorate itself yet
again.
<P>
First, how has this happened in the past? Is there any pattern to how
the West has been able to survive the institutionalization of its
instrument of expansion?
<P>
When we consider means, in each case where the institutions of the
West's Ages of Conflict have been reformed or circumvented by a new
instrument of expansion, it has been the West's positive attitude toward
technology that has provided the means for the new instrument. More
specifically, it appears to be dramatic improvements in transportation
technology that make a new instrument of expansion possible.
<P>
But why it is that transportation technology has been able to play such
a large role in the progress of the West? The answer can be summed up in
a single word: curiosity. One of the essential qualities of Western
civilization is the impulse so deeply and broadly ingrained in its
citizens to seek the unknown--to explore the frontier. The exploration
of intellectual frontiers is the hallmark of science, for example. And
the role of the physical frontier in the growth of the West (why is it
called "the West," do you think?) has been examined by historians for
over a century, most notably in Frederick Jackson Turner's
still-influential 1893 lecture, <A
HREF="http://www.bennington.edu/courses/history/archive/frontier.html"
TARGET="new"><I>The Significance of the Frontier in American
History</I></A>. (Observe how Turner's notion of "frontier" can be used
to define Quigley's "peripheral state." Turner's thesis that a frontier
society must be strong to survive corresponds nicely with Quigley's
observation that peripheral states are typically more energetic in their
various aspects than the core states of a civilization.)
<P>
The institution of the West's first Age of Conflict--municipal
mercantilism--derived from the exhaustion of opportunities for the
"have-nots" of the day to participate in Mediterranean and European
commerce. The limits on transport prevented the early Western economy
from expanding. When these limits were breached by the development of
ocean-worthy ship technology that allowed Atlantic commerce via the
exploration of the Americas, a new instrument of expansion became
possible. The improved transportation technology opened up new resources
which could not otherwise be tapped, and allowed more goods to be moved
more quickly between producer and consumer. The declining cost of being
a producer meant that more persons could afford to do so. And as more
individuals were able to bring their personal abilities and energy to
economic activity, the entire society benefitted. Internal competition
for existing resources declined in favor of external exploitation of new
resources. A new instrument of expansion heralded a new Age of
Expansion.
<P>
Similarly, the second Age of Conflict was resolved when the Industrial
Revolution opened up new frontiers to entrepreneurial exploitation and
innovation. As transportation became faster and cheaper, more people
could participate in economic activity.
<P>
But what about the West's third and most recent Age of Conflict? There
has been no breakthrough in transportation technology. (Space travel,
using merely improved versions of the rockets that propelled the early
V-2 flying bombs, cannot reasonably be called a "breakthrough.") Has
there, in fact, been some technology invented recently that opens up a
heretofore unknown but resource-rich frontier to human exploration?
<P>
Perhaps there has... if you accept the argument that the first cousin of
transportation is communication. Rather than moving physical goods from
one place to another, communication transfers ideas. Since, as patent
law for example recognizes, ideas are a form of property which can be
created, owned, and transferred, a new technology that allows more
individuals to join in the economic flow of ideas could be the key to
reforming the most recent institution of monopoly capitalism.
<P>
This notion of "information" as the true basic unit of economic activity
is a more fundamental and useful approach. What is transportation, or
communication, but energy harnessed for mobility? The critical component
of economic action then is, in a word, energy. In other words, it's not
what you move, or even how fast or how far you can move it, but rather
how much of it you can move in a given unit of time that serves as the
best measure of economic activity.
<P>
From a macro-level viewpoint, goods and services and even ideas are just
particular forms of energy resources. Looking at it in this way, the
measure of an economy is not how many warehouses are filled with goods,
or the amount of investment in new physical capital, but rather the
total amount of energy produced, moved, and consumed, no matter the
specific forms of that energy. While this measure of productivity is
more difficult to obtain, it is necessary to think of economic activity
in this way in order to appreciate the true change of economies in
history: from physical capital to intellectual capital. (Perhaps we can
call this trend "resource abstraction.")
<P>
If the preceeding argument is essentially sound, then I would further
argue that there has been, in fact, a key invention that has made
possible a new instrument of expansion. What's more, its creation and
exploitation coincide precisely with the apparent reduction in the
number and strength of the various institutionalized aspects of the most
recent Age of Conflict over the past forty years. As ocean-traversing
technology opened up the New World to physical exploration, this new
information-processing technology would open up the new world of
ubiquitous computers and on-demand global communication.
<P>
The technology that revived the West was the transistor. It can hold
a bit of information ("on" or "off") just like the bulky vacuum tube,
but it has no moving parts, no slow warm-up time, and even in its early
forms it was so much smaller than tubes that thousands and even millions
of them could be placed in one square inch to form specialized computing
sub-units.
<P>
The miniaturization (and associated speeding up) of information
processing capability led directly to the personal computer, and to
cheap, light communication devices with virtually global range. Now,
not only can information be transmitted almost instantaneously, cheap
storage and the Internet allow the creation of vast amounts of new
information. Of course not all information has value, any more than
natural resources such as dirt are more valuable than gold. But the
ongoing shrinking of the transistor and the corresponding increase in
computing power per unit area at least make it possible to produce some
few nuggets of valuable information where no such value existed before.
<P>
Now multiply this by the number of persons with access to this source of
value. As more and more people gain access to computers, and more
computers are connected to each other, and more source data is converted
to digital formats, the information that is the 21st century's gold
increases as well. This has already had a clear effect on the Western
economy, as the increased productivity of Western workers due to more
and better information has been a key reason why it was possible to
dramatically reduce national income tax rates and still see increased
revenues.
<P>
So it does seem that the West has a new instrument of expansion. The old
institution of monopoly capitalism seems to have been circumvented by a
new information-based form of capitalism. (In fact, if Carroll Quigley
were still here, perhaps he might call it "information capitalism."
<P>
To earlier forms of trade in physical goods and services we have added
trade in information; as physical capital is created by work encouraged
by investment, new information becomes a commodity available for
commercial transactions. As more persons gain access to information
processing technology--as slowly happened when agricultural workers
shifted from farming to industrial labor during the Industrial
Revolution--expansion is ignited once again, this time into an
Information Revolution.
<P>
And for the more distant future? If the West truly is enjoying a new,
transistorized instrument of expansion (returning it to Stage 3), then
it is likely to be too strong and dynamic to be destroyed for the next
several centuries. First, this new instrument would have to be
institutionalized, as all instruments have been and always will be.
<P>
It's difficult to imagine what form this institutionalization would
take. An instrument generally becomes an institution when the general
perception is that easily exploitable resources are running out. At this
time, those who profit most from the system begin restricting access to
it in order to retain their incomes from (what is then perceived to be)
a finite and shrinking supply of resources. But what are the limits to
human imagination, the wellspring of an information economy? Will we
return to the belief (infamously proposed by a U.S. Patent Office chief)
that we have "invented everything," and learned all there is to know?
<P>
Again, this isn't easy to imagine. But it's possible. Therefore,
assuming that it can happen again, that the "frontier" of networked
minds somehow becomes percieved as settled and closed--how will access
to this territory be restricted by the few to their advantage?
<P>
An information economy consists of three parts: users, information, and
the computers and communication links between users and information. The
most obvious point of control is the commmunication link. Therrefore, I
conclude that the institutionalization of the Information Revolution
will come once new ideas are no longer valued, and will be signified by
control of communication links passing into the hands of three, two, or
perhaps even one master. When this occurs, the transition to a new Age
of Conflict will be complete.
<P>
And once again Western civilization will have to reform or circumvent an
institutionalized instrument of expansion, or else pass into an
Universal State on its way to decay and destruction.
