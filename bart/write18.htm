<P>
  <I> My understanding of your argument is this:  If there is not a set of universally common symbols which
  can be interpreted consistently in a certain way, then dream interpretation (a) is not legitimately
  "interpretation" but highly subjective in the manner of personality profiles, for instance; and (b) cannot
  be verified by some scientific study or test. </I>
<P>
  Mmm.  Close enough.  (And nicely summarized.)
<P>
  To my mind, there are three factors which must be satisfied to conclude that there is a body of symbolic
  concepts universal enough to lift dream interpretation out of simple people skills into the realm of science:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Some symbols must be equivalent among enough individuals.</LI>
<LI>Enough such symbols must exist to form a complete language of understanding.</LI>
<LI>Dreams must accurately reflect those symbols in meaningful ways.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
  I have the distinct impression that you and I evaluate these three requirements in different ways.  (For
  that matter, you may not accept that these are truly required.  If so, you may of course question them,
  but for now I'll continue.)
<P>
  In the first regard, you say "Many dream symbols *often* (not *always*) have common meaning for people
  <EM>because</EM> a broad range of people all over the globe are taught these meanings (i.e.,
  water = life)."  Thus I think you're expressing the view that you think the first requirement is
  satisfied.  I'm not as certain as you seem to be about this.
<P>
  I've never said that dream symbols "always" must be held in common.  My position is that not enough
  of them are held to an equivalently common degree among enough individuals to constitute a trustable
  objective basis for sound analysis.
<P>
  To put it in a less fussily precise way *grin*, I think those first two requirements are mutually
  exclusive.  If there are symbols which are essentially equivalent among most humans, there aren't
  enough of them to constitute a full language by which to fully understand and interpret someone
  else's dreams.  Conversely, there may be a large number of concepts whose vague outlines we
  understand in common, but whose specific meanings--as expressed in, say, a dream--vary from
  person to person, and even from situation to situation.
<P>
  So I don't think the requirements of equivalency and universality can both be satisfied.  Thus
  on the basis that there are not enough concepts common enough to enough people, I can't justify
  the conclusion that any person can be capable of interpreting another person's internal symbolic
  concepts to any reasonably useful degree.
<P>
  What of those whose fear of drowning leads them to interpret water as a negative concept?  On
  what evidence do you conclude that there are so few of these persons that your interpretation of
  the water concept as equivalent to "life" constitutes the "right" interpretation?
<P>
  And that's <EM>without</EM> considering that third requirement.  Namely, how do we know that dreams
  necessarily reflect meaningful messages?  To advocate interpretation of dream symbols implies that
  those symbols are rationally organized messages which actually have some interpretable meaning... but
  where is the evidence in support of accepting this implication as fact?
<P>
  I've been interested in artificial intelligence for over two decades now, and in the process of
  trying to understand this field I've done a fair amount of reading on human brain function.  Based
  on that, it has seemed to me for a long time that dreams are merely artifacts of random neural
  firing in the brain--arbitrary activation of areas of the brain in which are stored whatever
  memories happen to be there.  If that's an accurate understanding, then there may be no connection
  whatsoever between dream images and rational "messages from the subconscious."  Thus, interpretation
  is futile, since there is no "meaning" inhering to a dream.
<P>
  (An additional point: The "lucid dreaming" field is interesting... but because it is essentially a
  waking dream under the control of the dreamer, it is by definition not a dream which needs
  interpretation.)
<P>
  All things considered, then, I am inclined to the view that dreams are not interpretable by second
  parties to any useful degree.  An individual may achieve personal insights from his or her own
  interpretations of random memory-based concepts, or even from the attempted interpretation of a
  second party, and that's fine.
<P>
  What I'm not persuaded to is the postition that an interpreter is either necessary or even useful
  in acquiring such enlightenment, given the significant subjectivity of meaning.
<P>
  "The Little Mermaid" notwithstanding. *grin*
