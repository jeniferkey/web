<H3>The Future of Cooperation</H3>

<P>For cooperation to evolve, there have to be enough cooperators
who interact with one another on a sufficiently regular basis.
Such &quot;islands of cooperation,&quot; once established, can
grow... but too small an island will sink beneath the waves of
defectors.
<P>
One critical factor not addressed by any other commentator on
Axelrod's work I've seen concerns being able to recognize other
players. The Tit for Tat strategy depends on remembering what
another player did on the immediately previous turn. But if the
other player is anonymous, or is encountered only once, it's
impossible to associate a history with that player. This leads
either to cooperating with an unknown (and possibly being taken
advantage of repeatedly) or defecting from lack of trust (and
possibly missing an opportunity to create an environment of
cooperation).
<P>
This takes on added relevance today. Not only are the streets
and highways filled with persons whom we'll never see again--and
who thus have no qualms about defecting (in other words, driving
like jerks)--we are spending more time surfing the Web as
anonymous entities than we once did sitting in the back yard
talking with our neighbors. Our contacts with other players in
the game of trust/don't-trust are more likely to be brief
encounters with strangers: ephemeral and anonymous. Under such
conditions, not only is it unlikely that new clusters of
cooperative behavior will evolve, but even the maintenance of
what cooperation there is becomes difficult. Trust breaks down.
<P>
How long can such a state of affairs last?

<P>
". . . perhaps the chief thesis of the book on <I>The Fatal Conceit</I>
. . . is that the basic morals of property and honesty, which created
our civilization and the modern numbers of mankind, was the outcome of a
process of selective evolution, in the course of which always those
practices prevailed, which allowed the groups which adopted them to
multiply most rapidly (mostly at their periphery among people who
already profited from them without yet having fully adopted them."<BR>
