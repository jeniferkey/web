<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<P>
One of the realizations to emerge from the recognition of the complexity
of modern human life is that the universe is full of systems.
<P>
Some of them even work.
<P>
Most of those which do, however, arose naturally.  That is, they are not
products of human ingenuity.  For all the fecundity of our imagination,
we consistently fail to create large-scale systems that work as well as,
say, gravity or photosynthesis.
<P>
Why is this so?  While some may be content to simply shake their heads,
roll their eyes, and mutter something along the lines of "humans are
just plain weird," I have a theory.  It is this: humans are just plain
impatient.
<P>
We want it now.  So we short-circuit the natural process of evolution by
designing a system to do what we want.  Rather than make infinitesimal
changes very gradually across a highly diverse and interconnected
environment, we make big changes very rapidly in an extremely narrow
field.
<P>
The result -- which should be predictable -- is usually failure, sometimes
on a massive scale with widespread unforeseen consequences.  When we
screw up, we tend to screw up big.
<P>
And yet... sometimes we get it right.  Sometimes we actually manage
to create working systems.  (Though even these often have unexpected
side effects.)  What some thinkers now propose is that these successes
are more likely when we understand and take into account the
fundamental laws of systems-behavior.
<P>
First came Ludwig von Bertalanffy (yes, that was his real name), who
provided a theoretical basis for understanding system behavior,
particularly that of natural systems.  This focus, however, prevented
Bertalanffy from recognizing the <EM>conscious</EM> design aspect of
human systems that allows some systems to work while others fail
miserably (and sometimes disastrously).
<P>
The spark that ignited this revolution in thinking in a practical way
about systems was left to an engineer, whose off-the-cuff insight led to
what must be considered the primal systems-law: "If anything can go
wrong, it will."  With this realization, the field of Systems Analysis
was born.
<P>
Rigorous research soon followed.  Count Alfred Korzybski (yes, that was
his real name, too) tried to put the study of systems on a firm
theoretical footing with his work on <I>General Semantics</I>.  Following
him came researchers of a more pragmatic turn of mind (and easier
names).  C. Northcote Parkinson focused on institutional systems.  His
<I>Economist</I> essay "Parkinson's Law" and other related work exposed
the significance of human action in systems-failures.  Lawrence J. Peter
(<I>The Peter Principle</I>) expanded the popular understanding of this
effect by cataloging examples in a familiar setting -- the office.
<P>
Finally, to give this field the aroma of respectibility it so richly
deserves, John Gall wrote a book called <I>Systemantics</I>, a play on
words based on the way "systems display antics."  Gall collected and
analyzed hundreds of examples of systems-failures, then from them
generalized a number of pithy and highly quotable Laws of Systems
Behavior, so of course his influence in this field cannot be
overstated.
<P>
(It should also be pointed out that some of Gall's Horrible Examples of
systems gone bad seem less about casting light on a theory than about
beating up on certain things he doesn't like, with anything to do with
splitting atoms heading the list.  Still, his work as a whole survives
these occasional excursions into personal score-settling.)
<P>
Although <I>Systemantics</I> is written with an air of facetiousness,
Gall does make three useful contributions to those of us who would like
to like to make the world work better but who aren't so much idealistic
reformers as pragmatic theorists:
<UL>
<LI>He identifies and catalogs common patterns of system behavior.</LI>
<LI>He promotes the viewpoint that systems-failure is inherent.</LI>
<LI>He offers practical advice on how to succeed by working
<EM>with</EM> systems.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
This, I think, is a positive approach to dealing with the natural
tendency of systems to display antics.  We all have to deal with
systems.  Why not try to learn their fundamental principles of operation
(or, more often, non-operation) so that we can improve our chances of
success?
<P>
I therefore present herewith those laws of system behavior which seem
like they might have the most value to those who want to produce working
systems in something less than geologic time.
<P>
Note: Some of these Laws of Systems Behavior are from Gall's
<I>Systemantics</I>, but the text discussing each Law is mine.  If you
have a gripe about the text associated with a Law, the fault is mine,
not Gall's.
<P>
Another note: It is useful to point out that, although the observations
which follow apply to all systems, they apply in particular to
<EM>human</EM> systems.  My point is to distinguish between mechanical
systems and systems of human interaction such as organizations or
institutions.  Mechanical systems tend either to work reasonably well or
else not at all.  But human systems, because their outputs are subject
to perception and interpretation, may actually continue to exist even
though they have long since ceased to perform the function for which
they were created.
<P>
So anything said about the bizarre behavior of systems in general goes
double (at least) for human systems.
