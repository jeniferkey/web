<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>A
Simulationist/Narrativist Manifesto</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2007/06/20</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm
getting increasingly tired of game designers treating the Simulationist and
Narrativist preferences as mere nice-to-haves (or, even worse, as undesirable
distractions) compared to Gamist features.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Worldiness
matters, dammit. Flinging a bunch of arbitrary, semi-random rules out there is
fine for some people, but there are others -- and I'm one of them -- for whom
that is utter junk. For us, a game where consistency is considered a
distraction is not fun, and it's not worth playing. Conversely, a game in which
consistency is respected, in which the objects and activities in that gameworld
fit into a coherent physical/sociological model, would make everything that
could be done in that game significantly more fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For us,
consistency increases fun. Are we irrelevant? Are our notions of what's fun
unworthy of respect? I don't think so, and I'm sick and tired of being being
told to go sit in the back of the bus and not get uppity by asking for the
gameworld to be designed in such a way that I'm an equal player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's time
for game designers to start treating Simulationist and Narrativist interests as
equals to Gamist preferences. All of these styles (and probably some of the
Experientialist mindset as well) need to be consciously considered when
designing content for a mass-market MMORPG. Excluding Simulationist and
Narrativist features means excluding logical and emotional consistency in the
game world. It means a lack of, yes, &quot;immersiveness.&quot; Any designers
who think that's either desirable or necessary in a game intended for broad
consumption have no business being paid to design games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
&quot;gameplay&quot; does <i>not</i> only mean catering to Gamist interests -- what
Simulationists and Narrativists (and Experientialists) enjoy doing for
structured fun counts as &quot;gameplay,&quot; too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Until
their interests are taken seriously by designing actual content for them, they
won't play these MMORPG things. And publishers will fail to make as much money
as they otherwise could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why
should any of us settle for that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>End
manifesto.</span></p>
