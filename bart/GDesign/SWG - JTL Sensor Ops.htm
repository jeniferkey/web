<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note that
&quot;active scans&quot; are detection-and-identification technologies that
send out some kind of signal and then read the signal that bounces back (or
not). (Think of these as like the sonar &quot;pings&quot; in movies about
submarine warfare.) Active scanning is good for resolving details about other
vessels, but it has the drawback of letting other ships know exactly where you
are and what you're doing. They use up a lot of power, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Passive
scans, by contrast, just take in information about other ships that they give
off or deliberately broadcast. These don't always give you a lot of detail, and
you need to be fairly close to the other ship for certain types of passive
scans to work, but they're good for detecting other ships when you don't want
to be detected yourself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So --
given all these ways that we can detect objects in space, and, once detected,
learn specific information about them, wouldn't it be interesting if JtL
allowed us to explore all these phenomena as sensor options?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You're a
Imperial frigate patrolling the spacelanes to control the piracy that's been
reported in this sector of space. Your active radar scan is always on,
&quot;pinging&quot; the space around you. This has the double effect of letting
you &quot;see&quot; any ships in range of your radar, but also of warning off
any Bad Guys (because they can detect your active scan).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Today
you're cruising along near a &quot;hot&quot; star (one that puts out a lot of
junk radiation that makes scans difficult) when your radar picks up a ship far
ahead. You move in close enough to run an ID scan (passively reading the ID
transponder code broadcast by all ships except pirates). The ID scan says it's
the <i>Ghazal</i>, a YT-1300 bulk freighter registered out of Corellia, but you
order your sensor operator to run a neutrino emission scan [to roughly
determine the ship's power output] and a gravitic displacement scan [to measure
the ship's tonnage] just in case. Given the recent outbreak of piracy, you want
to make sure this ship really is who she claims to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
passive scans report that the <i>Ghazal</i> is a little bigger than expected,
but within the upper boundary for freighters. Still, something in your gut is
nagging you. Your sensor technician is pretty good, so you order your ship in a
little closer and send to the <i>Ghazal</i> to submit to a routine cargo scan.
(You're a dedicated servant of the Empire; you don't ask for permission.)
Another ship shows up on the radar in the distance (too far for ID
transmission), but you want to finish with the <i>Ghazal</i> first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As you
close to visual (and cargo scanning) range of the <i>Ghazal</i>, your sensor
tech completes a set of active electromagnetic (EM) scans, and you can now see
the ship for yourself visually. She appears to have more gun turrets than the
typical bulk freighter... and the turrets appear to be sporting quad turbolaser
cannons, which are <i>way</i> more powerful than usual....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Suddenly
your sensor tech looks sharply up at you and says, &quot;Sir, infrared
emissions suggest that this ship is masking its real power signature!&quot; The
readings on the neutrino scan spike upward abruptly as the <i>Ghazal</i> feeds
power from its shielded (and sliced) engines to its weapons systems -- all of
which suddenly lock on to you. It's a pirate! She's been using illegal
technology to mask her power signature from other ships, and more illegal
technology to change her ID transponder code to that of a ship with no
outstanding warrants. This must be the ship that's been attacking the honest
merchants in this sector!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You order
your ship to power up its weapons, but the fake <i>Ghazal</i> is already firing
on you. Normally your frigate would be more than a match for a freighter, but
this is obviously no ordinary freighter... and that's when you notice that the
ship you had seen just at the edge of your radar is running toward you. And so
is the ship that has just appeared from out of the photosphere of that nearby
&quot;hot&quot; star, where it was using the noise of the star to hide from
most scans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Are these
ships friends coming to your rescue? Or are they more pirates, which could put
you in real jeopardy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You're
right about the applicability of this idea to capital ships, and I should have
said so. Let me try it now:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
stuff is really intended for multi-person ships, and not for starfighters.
Basically the only sensor stuff a starfighter needs is an integrated radar/ID
transponder analyzer to recognize other ships, an ID transponder of its own,
and possibly a sensor jammer (although all this is for is to make it harder for
other ships to get lockons). More advanced sensors are really only needed on
capital ships and certain highly tweaked freighters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Of
course, if other types of ships are ever introduced, such as research ships or
safari vessels, then they'd probably want more complete sensor packages, too.
But the full set of sensors (basically everything I proposed in my original
message) would really only be seen on purely military craft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As for
how to implement this idea, there are three key areas that would need code:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>ships
     must have the physical characteristics described (mass, radiation, etc.) </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>ships
     must have sensors that can read these characteristics of other ships </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>space
     features must block or distort some of these characteristics from sensors</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You could
get more complicated with the idea of ships having detailed characteristics
that can be detected, but these are the essential elements that would have to
be implemented in the <i>Jump to Lightspeed</i> code. The good news is that
once you have these three essential concepts coded to any degree, adding new
types of characteristics (and new sensors to reveal those characteristics)
would be relatively simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

Advanced sensors would never be necessary for players who just want to duke it
out, but players who enjoy exploring tactical options in combat need a detailed
sensor system. Ships must have enough properties (size, mass, heat/power
signature, ID, etc.), and space must have effects on those properties (nebulae
can hide your ship or light it up, stars can mask your radiation, etc.) to give
players a satisfying space combat experience beyond &quot;fly, shoot, fly,
shoot.&quot;</span></p>

Roleplaying</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>: As
suggested in the story of the Imperial frigate, having lots of sensor options
allows players to roleplay characters who employ tactics of deception, and
allows other players to roleplay characters who seek to expose what is hidden.
A rich sensing system makes these roleplaying styles possible.</span></p>

seamier parts of the galaxy are able to operate more openly... but some amount
of hiding is still necessary. A richly detailed sensor system offers a greater
number of more interesting gameplay options to SWG players who want to explore
the world of Boba Fett, Calo Nord, Prince Xizor, and others. In particular,
scanning technology as one form of sensor operations has been a part of Star
Wars products from the original movie (remember the Imperial scanning team that
goes -- briefly -- into the <i>Millenimum Falcon</i> on the Death Star?) to the
<i>TIE Fighter</i> space combat game (the cargo container scanning challenge)
that <i>Jump to Lightspeed</i> is to some degree supposed to resemble.</span></p>

up information on nearby energy sources without broadcasting your own location
(assuming you've turned off your ID transponder). Below your scope would be two
buttons: &quot;Passive EMS&quot; and &quot;Active EMS&quot;. Clicking on either
of these would reveal a radial menu of sensor options, including
&quot;All&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So if you
then clicked on &quot;Active EMS&quot; | &quot;All&quot;, your ship would start
&quot;pinging&quot; with the entire suite of active sensors to locate and describe
nearby objects. (This is where I'd like to see a Sensor Ops or Avionics
discipline -- someone with better sensor skills should be able to get more
information about other ships, in the same way that Scouts/Rangers get more
detailed creature stats.) Or you could choose &quot;Active EMS&quot; |
&quot;Radar&quot; and have your scope work just like it does now on the ground
(with possibly a couple of enhancements for space combat).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>This idea would also require some sort of object size vs.
ship size check.... a Star Destroyer would have a much harder time hiding in an
asteroid field than an X-Wing.... </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Which is
absolutely as it should be. An ISD basically shouldn't care if you can see it
-- in fact, the &quot;shock and awe&quot; they are intended to inspire <i>depend</i>
on their being seen; the big Imperial ships should normally be doing everything
they can to light up every sensor within a parsec. If their sheer size and
destructive capability can persuade you to give up because the Emperor is too
strong to fight, so much the better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>From the
Empire's point of view, of course. ;-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although
there are some Rebels who &quot;prefer a straight fight to all this sneakin'
around,&quot; you're right that the Rebellion would benefit more from having an
enhanced sensor environment in SWG. Being able to use &quot;natural cover&quot;
(nebulae, asteroids, stars, etc.) would give offer Rebels the tactical options
necessary for the shadowy hit-and-run strikes that should be their modus
operandi. (I don't recall seeing in the movies any Red Squadron pilots flying
around looking for TIE fighters and saying things like, &quot;d00d, u wanna
duel?&quot;, then cloning and doing it again....)</span></p>
