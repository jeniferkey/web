of the Five Magics</i></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I’ve
addressed elsewhere the question of whether magic in books and games should be
presented as a science or as an art. I didn't come to a conclusion, other than that
both forms can be fun to experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, Ursula K. LeGuin's original Earthsea trilogy (definitely not the much
later fourth book) was in large part so wonderful because it got at something
about what it is we find so fascinating about &quot;magic.&quot; The Earthsea
trilogy expressed the &quot;magic as art&quot; position superbly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For the
other approach, I can't think of a better example than Lyndon Hardy's novel <i>Master
of the Five Magics</i>. There were two semi-sequels, but MOTFM nailed the
premise of magic as a scientific undertaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Because
it took a somewhat more mechanistic approach to magic (as opposed to LeGuin's
naturalistic interpretation), I'm a little surprised not to have seen the
concepts of magic as expressed in Hardy's book show up in some MMORPG already.
For those who haven't had the pleasure, the five systems used by Hardy and
their governing laws are:</span></p>

Thaumaturgy is what we usually think of as magic. Using the principles of
sympathy and contagion, it's possible to move things, to transform things into
other things, and otherwise manipulate one's environment. (These principles
were used to great effect by de Camp and Pratt in their very funny
&quot;Compleat Enchanter&quot; novels, as when their hero shortens a jailer's
nose by forming a model of it in wax and melting it.) However, a strong spell
requires a great deal of energy, such a from a fire or a flywheel. And
thaumaturgy, while rule-based, is not an exact science -- sometimes changes
don't stop when they should....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Alchemy
is mostly as you expect it: by properly blending items with the appropriate
attributes you can obtain a final product with superior virtues, such as oils
of heat resistance or gold from lead. The only problem is that each step of the
blending process has a chance of failure -- for example, four out of ten times
a particular step in a process might produce lightning or an explosion instead
of the intermediate product you actually want. So you have to start with a much
larger quantity of initial substances than you wind up with... and the more
complex the changes, the more steps are required (and the lower the chance of
success on each step).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Hardy's
Magic is used to create magical objects. By repeatedly performing rituals of
great complexity, common objects can be imbued with properties they can confer
to their user. Rings can make their wearer invisible, carpets can fly, glass
spheres can give light, and so on. The more perfect the ritual, and the more
persistently it is applied, the greater the power of the object. Naturally, if
you fail to correctly perform any ritual at any point, the object being given
power will probably be destroyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sorcery
grants the arts of illusion, of enchantment, of clairvoyance, of fate, and of
prophecy. Each of these is activated by speaking a charm three times, which
sounds simple enough, but the more complex charms do not want to be said --
each word becomes more difficult to utter. The most complex sorcerous charms
are nearly impossible to speak, but must be said without error (and cannot be
abandoned once begun). A mistake will produce hallucinations, pain, and even
death in the most powerful cases. But even if one succeeds, some amount of
one's life force is drained away forever. Cast too great an enchantment with
too little life force remaining, and goodbye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
Wizardry is about summoning and binding demons to your will. Flame is used as a
connection to the demon's realm and the Law of Dichotomy requires that there
must always be a contest between the summoner and the summoned. Fail to
dominate, and the summoned demon will control the summoner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The nice
thing about all these powers is that there's a cost to them. None of the five
magics are to be taken lightly, even if you succeed. In a story, that's great
for setting up dangers to be overcome; in a computer game, it would be
excellent for producing a more thoughtful approach to the application of power.
No charging in swinging with these abilities!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Hmm. And
maybe right there is the answer why these five styles of magic haven't been
used in a new MMORPG....</span></p>
