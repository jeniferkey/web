<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2005/06/15</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
not just one type of &quot;crafter&quot;: there are two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
people like crafting for its own sake; they enjoy the process of making new and
interesting products. Others take up crafting as a sales game; their interest
is in economic competition. Designers need to recognize that these are
different kinds of players with different goals who aren't going to be
motivated by just one kind of reward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
&quot;pure&quot; crafters are best described by Richard Bartle's original <a
href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">fourfold typology of gamers</a> as
Explorers, while the players more interested in crafting as a sales game are
much more likely to be Achievers. Explorer crafters enjoy playing with the
options and features of the crafting system; their goal is to explore the
possibility space. Achiever crafters feel satisfaction when they can dominate
the market for the sale of the products they produce; their goal is to
outcompete other sales crafters on either quality or volume or both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What this
means is that we get confused when we talk about what &quot;crafting&quot;
should be like. For an Achiever, whose interest is in accumulating things (like
high-end objects and enormous bags full of money), improving crafting means
streamlining the production process (more goods produced per unit of time
invested) and exposing more goods to more potential buyers (more income per
unit of time invested).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But for
an Explorer (like me), improving crafting means that the research and design
and experimentation and architectural and creative aspects of building new
things should reward ingenuity, not time invested. &quot;Crafting&quot; to an
Explorer means playing with the rules of a production system, not actually
operating and maintaining such a system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These are
two radically different motivations for play. One is about adding to the
economy through the creative generation of novel products; the other focuses on
competing for scarce resources (recognition as the &quot;best&quot; and other
players' money). Confusing the Explorer and Achiever playstyles -- treating
them as identical because they're both &quot;crafters&quot; -- leads to bad
gameplay and unhappy gamers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>New
crafting recipes are a small benefit to both types of crafter, but ultimately
they're more important to the Achiever crafter. For the Explorer crafter, once
a recipe has been used, the novelty that made it interesting is gone. The
Achiever crafter, on the other hand, can happily crank out many units of the new
object if it's perceived as something other players might want to buy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Thus a
developer belief that all &quot;crafters&quot; need to remain satisfied are a
few new recipes is incorrect, because not every crafter benefits equally from
new recipes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorer-type
crafters should not be forced to try to play like Achievers. That's never going
to work well. Not only does this disadvantage the kind of crafting they're good
at -- crafting as a creatively constructive activity -- there's no way they can
compete economically with players who'll do anything to beat them. The result
can only be to unnecessarily drive away the Explorer crafters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
nothing inherently wrong with sales competition, and for those who like that
sort of thing, it's a lot of fun. It's also economically useful in a MMOG
because it helps to maintain an efficient market for goods. Crafting-as-sales
is good to have in a game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But why
must crafting be <i>only</i> about sales competition? Both creativity and
competition are worthwhile motivations, so why not design crafting systems that
support and reward both motivations?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
alternative is to explicitly design both a production-focused crafting subgame
and a process-focused crafting game. These should complement each other.
Process crafting would be the means by which new products and processes are
discovered through experimentation, and should be required to purchase
specialized tools created by production crafters. Rather than being forced to
subsidize their work through sales, they might better be supported by some kind
of salary, with perhaps an R&amp;D bonus proportional to how often products
made from their discoveries are used by consumers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Meanwhile,
production crafting should be designed as an optimization game that rewards
whoever can generate the most units of product at the least cost for the most
quality. They need new recipes and fabrication processes from R&amp;D crafters
(perhaps acquired through a bidding system for recipes and processes where the
identity of the R&amp;D crafter is hidden) in order to offer new products to
consumers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
dual-track but unified crafting system would serve all players. Explorer
crafters would be rewarded for their skill in discovering new aspects of the
crafting system; Achiever crafters would be rewarded for their skill in making
things; and consumers would gain access to desirable products.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Side
note: My personal preference is actually to generalize crafting as a resource
delivery system. Following this perspective, it might be fun to offer four
types of &quot;crafting&quot;: R&amp;D, production, distribution, and sales.
R&amp;D players could design new products and processes; production players
could build optimal products and processes; distribution players would act as
traders, carrying products as cargo; and sales players could seek to build
fortunes by placing buy and sell orders. It might also be worthwhile to define
some skills or classes for hunting/prospecting so that players can travel the
world supplying raw resources for production -- this would combine the resource
game with physical exploration and some PvE combat.</span></p>
