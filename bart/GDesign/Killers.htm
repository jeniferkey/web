<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My idea
of a great MMORPG is one where Achievers, Explorers, and Socializers are all
consciously given features that are fun for them and that indirectly support
the gameplay of players with different playstyles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>They've
been called many things -- Killers, Manipulators, Dominators (as well as things
I can't print here) -- but the common thread is that they get their kicks by
messing with the gameplay of other players. This makes them distinct from the
other three main types of gamer in my model.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Not
saying this is Right -- it's just my working model.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Achievers,
Explorers, and Socializers all bring something positive to a game. Killers? Not
so much. If there's a &quot;griefer&quot; type, it's the Killer. (That doesn't
mean other types can't be griefers; it's just considerably less likely.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If
there's any hope of integrating Killers into a MMOG, it may come from stepping
back from gaming and thinking of Killers in terms of their larger personality
context. In my model, the Killer is a MMOG-specific subset of the Artisan
temperament. Although Artisans can have their problems, there are aspects of
this temperament that are valuable to individuals and society. Maybe if games
were designed to elicit these positive aspects of the Artisan temperament
instead of the negative, we could include all four of the major playstyles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
reason I prefer to call Killers &quot;Manipulators&quot; is because the latter
term does a better job of capturing the spirit of what these folks really enjoy
doing: they are the masters of manipulating things and people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We see
them manipulating the developers when they test the boundary conditions of the game
world and every thing in that world. And we see them manipulating people in
MMOGs because that's what MMOGs are designed to allow. MMOGs that offer 24x7
non-consensual PvP in particular attract the negative type of Manipulator. What
if MMOGs catered less to the dark side of human endeavor? What if games found
ways to get your adrenaline pumping that didn't involve the wholesale slaughter
of living things? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For some
possibilities, let's step back and consider the more general case of the
Artisan. There are four areas where Artisans excel, and in which we might find
something positive around which useful Manipulator gameplay could be designed:
manipulating things, manipulating people, taking risks, and taking action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Artisans naturally enjoy manipulating things. Because they are able to perceive
the finest details of the physical world, they make extraordinary crafters and
users of solid things, real things. Even more so than Guardians (with whom
Artisans share a focus on externalities), Artisans are the consummate
tool-users. This emphasis on perceiving the real puts them at a disadvantage in
a computer game. In the first place, society says computer games are just
childish diversions; they aren't &quot;real&quot; at all. And in the second
place, there's no tactile information available about things in a game -- it's
all just mouse and keyboard and bits on a screen. But if there were a game that
was highly realistic in its visual and functional representation in-game
objects, and that allowed players with strong perceptiveness of that reality to
feel and modify the properties of specific objects, then you might see this
more positive side of Manipulators emerge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
Explorers/Rationals can become good at using tools, too. But there's a big
difference between &quot;becoming good at&quot; and &quot;being good at.&quot;
Artisans are naturally talented; Rationals have to study and practice and study
more and practice more. It drives Rationals nuts to see an Artisan pick up a
guitar or a miter saw for the first time and do more with it in ten minutes
than the Rational has figured out how to do in ten years. But that's just how
things are.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. The
most gifted people in sales or politics are often Artisans; they raise the
manipulation of people to an art form. (The same may be said of con men.)
Again, it's a matter of perception; in this case, perceiving the reactions of
people. Social Artisans get a thrill out of watching other people and figuring
out how to persuade them to some end. They're not allowed to kill you, so
taking your money or your support -- and making you like it -- is the next best
thing. Although Achievers like collecting money and are willing to compete hard
for it, the most hardcore merchants with the most money are likely to be
Manipulators who are &quot;making a killing&quot; in a different venue.
Similarly, although extroverted Socializers can make good politicians, the ones
with the most followers (and probably the most rabid, take-no-prisoners
followers) are likely to be Manipulators. Their charisma and energy and apparent
focus on other people make them natural leaders... but you'd better keep an eye
on the family silverware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3.
Although it's not as positive, Artisans are also attracted to risk. Most
serious gamblers are Artisans. If a MMOG offers opportunities to take big risks
to win big payoffs, Manipulators will be there. (Artisans find it easy to
attract people, but can have trouble maintaining relationships. This need for
risk is a big reason why.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. Finally,
Artisans love motion, movement, action. Fighter jet pilots, test pilots, race
car drivers, speedboat racers -- if it flies high or goes fast, they're
interested. Artisans love these activities and excel at them because their
perceptions are so complete and so fast. This aspect also includes some risk,
which is why someone who enjoys jumping out of a perfectly good airplane is
likely to be an Artisan. A MMOG that offers heart-pumping, real-time action in
conjunction with some form of manipulating people or things in the game world
is highly likely to attract Manipulators.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Overall,
I believe there might be ways to safely attract Manipulators to a MMOG and
retain them without driving off all your other players. The question is whether
it would be worth the design, coding, and testing effort to do so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm
inclined to think &quot;yes&quot; because I know that there are worthwhile
things Artisans offer to the rest of us. But I don't think it will be easy. As
long as MMOGs insist that &quot;people will only pay to play combat-focused
games,&quot; and content is mostly about exterminating every form of life in
the game, those games will attract mainly the sociopathic Killers.</span></p>
