<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the strongest threads running through all the Star Wars movies is the
continuous bustle of commerce. Even while great events take place, people are
still trying to live their lives and make a credit or two. Whether moisture
farmers, junk dealers, smugglers, bounty hunters, clone breeders, droid
manufacturers, or members of a cantina band, there's a whole world of
commercial activity constantly operating behind the scenes (and sometimes right
up front!).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
great variety in what people do -- from the little guy to the hero -- is part
of the richness of Star Wars. SWG does a good job of reflecting this part of
the saga by offering lots of professions that aren't just about swashbuckling,
and by making these more commercial activities an integral part of the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Obviously
a lot of folks are looking forward to the Space Expansion in terms of its
similarity to <i>Star Wars: X-wing vs. TIE Fighter</i>. That's fine; this opens
up the Space Expansion to the heroic aspect of Star Wars, and that's
important... but what about the opportunities for commercial activity? How can
the Space Expansion support the regular folks over whom the GCW is being fought
but who aren't directly involved in that conflict because they're out making a
living?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I.
MISSIONS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
simplest option will be to add new NPC missions that take players into space.
As with ground-based missions, purely commercial missions will probably come in
three forms:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>skills-based
     missions </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;open&quot;
     missions</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>space-based
     factional missions (as these aren't primarily commercial I don't discuss
     them here)</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A.
Skill-Based Missions</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
missions are given based on a player's skills. For example, a player with
crafting skills might be offered a mission to build replacement hull plating
for an orbiting ISD, or a mining droid for an NPC on a space station in an
asteroid belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A variant
of this could be a Repair mission. In this mission type, you could (for
example) be asked to travel to some NPC starship to fix some broken system.
&quot;Captain Znarxes doesn't have anyone aboard who can repair his hyperspace
motivator. Take your repair kit and get out there now.&quot; (Of course
crafters will need to have a Repair skill for this to work. Ahem.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
types of skills-related missions could be Survey missions (&quot;I need a good
source of Zagallik Crystalline Gemstone in the Tharpid Nebula -- find me one
over 64% and I'll make it worth your while&quot;), Destroy missions
(&quot;Those cursed mynock are destroying the power cables of this station! Get
rid of them for me and you'll be well rewarded.&quot;), and Entertain missions
(&quot;That's it! You're exactly what I need for my new act! Get over to the
Rassid Space Colony -- I'll put the waypoint in your datapad -- and play one of
your songs for my old friend Hessalian. You'll be great!&quot;)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>B.
&quot;Open&quot; Missions</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These are
missions that anyone can take. The most common type of open mission is the
Delivery mission, where you're asked to carry some object to an NPC at some
distant location. The Space Expansion may include some new planets, but the
really interesting new missions will be the ones whose endpoint is somewhere in
space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe the
target NPC is on a space station. Even more interesting, suppose the target is
on board a starship? &quot;Captain Teekul is expecting delivery of these maps.
You can find her on board her ship, the <i>Nasturtium</i>, currently in orbit
over Mos Eisley on Tatooine. Get going.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
types of open missions include the usual Escort and Recon missions. The Space
Expansion variants of these could mean leading a crippled ship through a
pirate-infested area, or visiting the heart of a dense asteroid field to see
who's hiding there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
if the Space Expansion implements multi-person ships, a new type of mission
could be possible: the Transport Mission. This would allow NPCs to pay you to
take them to other places. If the NPC automatically exits (and pays you) the
moment you land, then I don't see much room for griefing this feature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>II.
FREIGHT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Freight&quot;
is the name for goods that someone else owns but which you carry. A freighter
is thus a ship whose primary purpose is carrying someone else's stuff from one
place to another -- sort of like UPS or FedEx in space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is a
standard kind of space commerce in science fiction, and it wouldn't hurt to
have it as a form of economic activity in SWG since it's easy money. But to be
perfectly honest... it's sort of boring. I wouldn't holler if it wasn't part of
the initial launch of the Space Expansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
Item delivery doesn't really need to be part of the Space Expansion, anyway.
This would be better implemented using a Player Contract system as described in
my various messages on that subject [#4421 and 15183 in this forum].)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>III.
CARGO</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Cargo&quot;
is the name for goods that you actually own that you buy in one place and ship
to another place in the speculative hope of turning a profit on the deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
where the Space Expansion could really shine in terms of commercial activity.
Space trading games have been seen in all kinds of games, from tabletop RPGs
like MegaTraveller to computer games like Freelancer, but they all have several
features in common:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>multiple
     types of goods that have different costs and storage requirements</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>multiple
     locations that offer some goods and want other goods</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>dynamic
     pricing (some items are more in demand than others, and this changes)</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To some
extent, SWG already has most of these features in place. There are several
features the Space Expansion could implement that would make these existing
commercial features more meaningful:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>allow
     some ships to have large cargo spaces</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>products
     should have specific handling requirements based on their attributes</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>NPCs in
     cities should occasionally offer missions to address &quot;shortages&quot;</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A.
Cargo Spaces</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The most
important part of a commercial game is a dynamic player economy that springs up
to address an excess demand in one place by transferring an excess supply from
some other place, and to make a profit in the exchange. In SWG, any crafter
anywhere can build anything locally. So dynamic markets in SWG mostly amount to
moving good resources from one planet where they're spawning to another planet
where they aren't.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When
Naboo or Tatooine isn't producing a non-ferrous metal with a decent Shock
Resistance rating, Master Artisans on those planets who run out of stockpiled
resources can't craft high-quality vehicles. But if Corellia or Dantooine does
have such resources, it might be cost-effective to buy them from someone who's
importing them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Right now
that import business is a tough one to be in. Not only do you have to have
enough sales to recover the money you spend traveling from one planet to
another, not only will you spend a lot of time traveling and sampling, but the
10-lot limit places a serious restriction on whether you can harvest a broad
enough spectrum of resources to be sure of always having something worth
selling. (The more gregarious players will &quot;borrow&quot; lots from other
players, but not every player is comfortable with making such arrangements.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The final
difficulty is only being able to carry around 120 or so items (and that's if
you carry droids with storage compartments). That may seem like a lot, but
consider that you can have possibly 30 or 40 different types of resources per
planet. Since you need to keep track of these somehow to avoid re-sampling,
your choices are either to write down all the attribute values of every
resource from every planet to keep track of what's current everywhere (not an
attractive proposition), or keep a small sample of every current resource in
your inventory. The latter chews up inventory space like crazy, but even so
it's easier than writing the relevant information down. But it can only be done
for one (or possibly two) planets before you run out of inventory slots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The Space
Expansion really becomes useful if some ships are able to carry many more items
-- say, 250 or so. At that point, the Space Expansion starts to really mean
something for commercial activity because it will support what people actually
want to do -- keep track of current resources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note:
Even better would be to have a good in-game way to store samples of current
resources and their attributes (a more specific way than just a general
notebook). In this case, fewer ship cargo spaces would be necessary for simply
storing samples; they could instead be used for actually hauling meaningful
quantities of materials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>B.
Materials Handling Characteristics</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Different
types of objects should have different characteristics that require different
transport mechanisms. This is an extra bit of &quot;realism&quot; that has a
big payoff in making the cargo game more interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If all
materials have the same handling characteristics, then the cargo game is little
more than freight hauling with a little more profit. But when different types
of materials have different transport costs due to handling requirements, that
adds an interesting wrinkle to the calculations of what will make a good profit
from what won't... and that's exactly what makes a commercial game fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Transporting
inert Inorganics (Metals, Inert Gases) should be simple and cheap. But moving
reactive Inorganics (Reactive Gases, Radioactives) might call for special
handling, such as Lead Containers or Magnetic Containment Vessels. These would
be available from Artisans -- at a price, of course. To make it even more fun,
materials might be classified as Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk, and the
appropriate containers for that type of material might require a container
capable of mitigating that risk level. For example, a Radioactive with a
Potential Energy value above 667 might be classified as a High Risk material,
and would require a container crafted to include a Lead Shielding Level 3
component.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
Organics (Flora, Hides, Meats, animal DNA) should break down and be slowly lost
unless stored in pressurized and temperature-controlled containers (again,
these could simply be optional components of a new Cargo Container object).
Other Organics (firearms, grenades, mines, pharmaceuticals) might be hazardous
in various additional ways. (And of course transporting live NPCs or PCs should
require passenger berths, but more on that below.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
kinds of designations for items (items should be classifiable into multiple
categories) could be Contraband (spices, some weapons, factional plans/orders),
Valuables (artwork, cut gems, currency), and Information (bulk mail [from NPC
missions], schematics, waypoints).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>C.
Shortages</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the biggest draws to playing a commercial game is the belief that one day
you'll strike oil. What makes the daily grind endurable is feeling that one day
you'll get rich by being in the right place at the right time with the right
product. (The real secret, of course, is just hard work over a long time and
investing smartly, but it's the belief in &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; schemes
that keeps many people playing the commercial game.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG's
dynamic resource generation system one of the necessary pieces for encouraging
this belief in players. (This feature is actually one of the unsung heroes of
SWG -- it's crucial for the existing commercial game and for the SWG economy
generally, but it hasn't anywhere near the praise it deserves for what it
contributes to the game.) What would improve this system for commerce in the
era of the Space Expansion would be occasional &quot;disasters&quot; based
around NPC cities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You
wouldn't want to impose negative events (even notionally) on player cities,
since some players would feel picked on if their city appeared to suffer in any
way compared to other cities. But suppose one day some number of the NPCs
standing around in Kor Vella started complaining of a disease infecting the
local farms which only Rorian Wild Wheat had the right nutrients to cure. If
these NPCs for one day offered missions to bring back 1000 units of this
resource, paying 10,000 credits and +50 &quot;Townspeople&quot; faction on
delivery would spur a burst of commercial space traffic to import this resource
to meet the brief local demand. Similar stories could be generated to explain
needs for various other kinds of resources in different places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
could be interesting variations on this. One modification would be to more
closely tie such events in with other aspects of the Space Expansion. Since we
know virtually nothing about the Space Expansion at this date
(*cough*hint*cough*), it's hard to speculate on exact mechanisms. But perhaps
at the same time as some resource becomes in demand in certain cities, Hutt- or
other criminally-factioned ships appear in the skies above that planet offering
higher prices (and perhaps appropriate faction points) for that resource.
Players would have to decide whether to make a fast buck, or whether helping
out farmers was more ethically satisfying. (This decision might even be worth a
few Dark Side or Light Side points if you're a Jedi.) Or maybe the resources
are interdicted in some way, and only a player with good Piloting or Smuggling
skills can successfully move the resources through Customs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
potential improvement would be to tie temporary demands in with the GCW. Maybe
several Rebel bases spawn outside Moenia, each with a Captain asking for 1000
units of Seafah Crystalline Gemstone with an Entanglement Resistance above 700
(which has been chosen in part because none is currently available on Naboo).
In return for 1000 resources, she'll pay 15,000 credits and +50 Rebel faction.
At the same time, the Imperial presence above Naboo is intensified somewhat,
and (assuming the Space Expansion allows this) random searches of ships above
Naboo are conducted more frequently for the presence of this material.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And this
just assumes the existence in the Space Expansion of the current planets/moons.
What if there are new planets with unique resources? What if we can mine asteroids?
The creation of new places to explore also offers the opportunity to add new
kinds of resources to the current crop -- perhaps things like different
products keyed to specific dangerous creatures (&quot;Organic, Creature, Bile,
Sarlacc&quot;) -- getting 1000 units of that might be a real challenge!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Overall,
the point is to have brief, localized &quot;shortages&quot; of a particular
resource. Players who discover this need would be able to profit; those who
don't but who hear about events like this would be encouraged to participate in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Passengers&quot;
is the name for -- well, for passengers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If the
Space Expansion allows some ships to carry multiple players (in the same way
that multiple players can be inside a house simultaneously), then the bare
necessities for passenger service will be in place. This would at least allow
informal travel arrangements. (&quot;Give me 10,000 credits and I'll take you
to any NPC city on Tatooine.&quot; &quot;We'll give you 2000 now... plus
another 15,000 when we reach Mos Espa.&quot;)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
suppose I take your money, then I land on Dathomir and /eject you from my ship?
In an informal system, this is all too possible. To avoid ripping off potential
travelers, it may be necessary to tweak the travel system somewhat in this way:
If you take someone on board your ship as a paying passenger, then they get to
set your destination (unless some other passenger has already set your ship's
destination, in which case you'd have the option of going there or getting your
money back and waiting for another ship). When you launch and go into
hyperspace, you go directly to that destination. And when you reach that
destination, the moment you exit the ship your money is credited to the ship's
owner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This system
would allow potential passengers to travel with some assurance that the ship
owner wouldn't be able to leave them stranded on some dangerous planet. Bad
things might still happen -- there could be a hyperspace malfunction, or
pirates might catch you, or if your captain is factioned your ship might be
attacked by a ship of another faction. But these things would typically hurt
the ship captain, too, so he or she would be motivated to bring passengers
safely to their destination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
Secure travel arrangements could also be made through a player contract
system.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Assuming
passenger service is possible, one interesting Space Expansion feature might be
the ability to fit ships with passenger staterooms. There could be several
levels of quality, from Efficiency (it's just a small room with no windows) to
Standard (a decent-sized, one-porthole room with a few amenities that will let
you drop up to five small inanimate items) to Luxury (a large,
lavishly-appointed room with picture windows that will let you drop up to 20
medium-sized inanimate items). How cool would it be if a player could own a
line of large passenger ships equipped with numerous luxury staterooms?
Naturally passengers will be charged appropriately for traveling in such
opulence....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
notion of staterooms into which passengers can drop items brings up the
question of whether larger ships might be able to function as residences, or as
city or PA halls. If you're a paying passenger in a Standard or Luxury
stateroom, then paying your money should cause one stateroom aboard that ship
to grant you (and only you) admin permissions. You should be able to drop items
in that room (but nowhere else), and no one else (including the ship owner or
pilot) should have access to that room or to those items without your
permission.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The one
tricky issue is what happens when you land at your destination. When you land
and exit the ship, your access rights to your stateroom must be revoked... but
what if you leave the ship with items still in &quot;your&quot; stateroom? The
only thing I can think is that you should be prevented from leaving any ship
while items you own aren't carried on your person. If you try, you'll be given
a pop-up window asking you if you want to give up all items in your stateroom
-- this would give you a chance to go back to your stateroom and collect your
possessions, after which you'd be able to leave freely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Obviously
the Space Expansion should support smuggling!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Imperial
patrol ships in space should harass players just as stormtroopers do in
cantinas. If you wind up near Imperial ships, you'll risk being pulled over by
a very well-armed Imperial patrol ship and searched for contraband.
&quot;Honest&quot; merchants will just be verbally assaulted, but smugglers
found to be carrying proscribed goods (weapons, spice, or anything
Rebel-factioned) who fail a random check will have some of their goods
confiscated and may be attacked, as will any ship that tries to run from a
search. (How fast you can jump to hyperspace could be an interesting factor here!)
As with the ground game, ships controlled by Imperials could be immune to
search-and-seizure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Naturally
we'll want to be able to craft ships with &quot;secret compartments&quot; for
hiding a few goodies that not everyone needs to know about -- a five-item
container should work. These compartments would be subject to being scanned; if
such a compartment is detected, then your ship would be subject to search. If
something is found, then you're subject to the consequences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The other
part of this is that Smuggling skills should be augmented to improve a ship's
resistance to scans. (Ships might also be built with scan-resistant
technology... at a much higher price.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
also the ground game to consider. We don't yet know how the Space Expansion
will handle landing ships, however, so it's hard to speculate usefully on this
now. However, if there's anything like &quot;landing&quot; at all, then it
should be possible to have something like Customs, in which case this is also a
point at which your ship might be subject to search.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A final
possibility for Smugglers in the Space Expansion will be hiring their specially
equipped ships to smuggle cargo for other characters. The most obvious way to
do this will be as a mission taken from an NPC, so hopefully this feature (as
noted above) will be implemented along with the Space Expansion. But it would
also be a lot of fun for players to be able to use Smugglers. Maybe a Rebel
city on Lok needs a shipment of crates of ranged weapon powerups. Maybe a
neutral city on Rori thinks there's big money to be made selling spice, but is
low on product. If Player Contracts were available (I know, I just can't shut
up about this ), players could make these kinds of Smuggling deals and
countless others.</span></p>

PIRACY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Many
people have expressed a strong interest in Space Expansion features that would
make some form of space piracy possible. Since there are economic
ramifications, we should talk briefly about piracy here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Piracy in
SWG boils down to two questions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Can
characters on Ship A board Ship B against the will of Ship B's crew or
passengers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. Can
characters who board a ship take that ship or loot any of the stuff on that
ship?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A.
Boarding</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The first
question of piracy concerns boarding. And the first question of boarding is
docking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If we
want piracy, docking has to be possible. But to prevent it from being used
inappropriately, it also needs to follow PvP rules. I'd like to see these
requirements implemented through a /dock command whose success or failure is
determined in two steps:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>faction</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>consent</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First of
all, ships of different faction don't need consent to board each other. Based
on what we currently believe to be true, military ships can be considered to
have a &quot;faction&quot; since they can only be purchased by spending faction
points. (Note that this appears to exclude &quot;uglies.&quot;) However, if
it's also possible to have armed non-military ships, then the faction of these
ships should be taken from the faction of the owner (or the pilot if the pilot
isn't the owner).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Given
these rules, ships of different faction should always be able to dock with each
other; no consent should be required. If I'm an commanding an Imperial ship and
you're Rebel scum (or if criminal faction is ever implemented and either of us
has it), and if I can destroy or disable your engines to keep you from running,
then I should be be able to dock my ship to yours and board you whether you
like it or not -- it's part of the risk you run by being overtly factioned in
space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(It
should be noted that in the case of Rebel vs. Imperial or vice versa, neither
would be acting as a pirate by boarding the other's ship; that would just be an
extension of other military action. Only non-military ships not of Rebel or
Imperial faction can technically be pirates -- a Rebel/Imperial factioned
non-military ship that attacks a ship of the other faction is more correctly
considered a &quot;privateer.&quot; Privateers won't exist if only military
ships may be Rebel or Imperial factioned in the Space Expansion. We'll just
have to see.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Non-factioned
use of /dock should require that the target of the /dock request give consent
to be docked to. This should hold whether the target is another ship, or a
space station, or a landing facility. If the target of a /dock request is
neutral, then that target must explicitly consent to being docked to. If
players could also choose who could board their ship, this would eliminate most
if not all potential for forcing player characters to defend their lives and
their ships from player pirates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If it's
possible for NPC pirates to dock to our ships then I hope we'll see some
features that allow us to defend our ship when it's boarded. Internal security,
chain of command, automated defenses, Space Marines(?), and of course a
self-destruct capability -- all these are features that would give the defender
a fighting chance. Naturally NPCs should have these features on their ships as
well, to defend against evil player pirates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It would
be a hoot if the Blas-Tech Plasma Cut Boarding Device were available. (Remember
how the Empire boarded Leia's &quot;diplomatic ship&quot; at the start of the
original <i>Star Wars</i>?) But there's one thing I definitely want to see if
my ship is boarded: I want to be able to hit the button that turns on the
&quot;Intruder Alert&quot; klaxon and flashing red lights all over my ship....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

Looting</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The other
big question is whether we'll be allowed to take stuff from defeated ships, or
possibly even take ships themselves as prizes. My guess is that no, this won't
be part of the Space Expansion... unless it's an NPC ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Looting
may simply not be permitted if the target ship is PC-controlled. Even in PvP
duels the victor doesn't get to take any of the loser's stuff (although that's
exactly how it worked in medieval jousts, and how I think it should work in SWG
to really make dueling interesting). The developers have chosen not to allow
the victors of PvP ground combat to loot the corpses of those who lose, and I
don't expect that they'll choose to allow this in space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Piracy of
PC ships by PCs may be limited to the faction points you can earn by destroying
enemy ships and killing their (factioned) crew; piracy of PC ships by NPCs may
be limited to killing the crew. But it might still be possible for players to
earn reputations as &quot;pirates&quot;... as long as they're satisfied with
targeting NPC ships. You should probably be able to take stuff from the cargo
holds of captured ships in addition to whatever you found on the bodies of your
victims. And if you could take NPC ships as prizes, that would make victory
even sweeter. Given the likely cost of ships, it would certainly be an economic
advantage... and the financial aspect of piracy is why we're talking about it
at all here.</span></p>

Other Features</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
&quot;command&quot; system for operating a starship would add to the
roleplaying part of the game, but it would also help protect ships from
pirates. When someone first creates a ship from its deed, he takes on the
additional role of &quot;captain&quot; with access to all ship functions
(direction control, fire control, etc.). He can then designate another player
as &quot;second-in-command,&quot; who has access to some subset of ship
functions. Should the captain be killed or exit the game, the second-in-command
becomes captain and can then designate another player as second-in-command, and
so on. (If the owner logs back in, he's automatically captain again as soon as
he boards the ship.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A ship's
captain (regular or acting) would have access to various commands that other
players aboard the ship wouldn't have, such as the option to allow firing on
another vessel, the ability to name another second-in-command, and the always
popular self-destruct feature. (Allowing a random passenger to accidentally
blow your ship out of space would probably not be a popular feature.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This command
concept would make piracy a more interesting challenge. A well-defined command
structure would prevent a ship from being captured as long as there was a
captain who refused to surrender. (&quot;/surrender [playername]&quot;, which
would cede ownership of one's current vehicle to another player, should be a
command available to any vehicle owner/captain.) Pirates would thus have to
destroy the chain of command before they could loot (or possibly take
possession of) a boarded ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
please note that all these rules apply whether only NPCs can be pirates or
whether player characters are allowed to be pirates as well. NPC pirates should
be able to board ships that have allowed them to dock (or been forced by
faction to allow them to dock); this should open their ships up to being
boarded as well (and possibly even captured as prizes). PC pirates may not be
subject to having their ships seized, and PCs boarded by pirates may not lose
their ships, but some amount of goods should be up for grabs either way to make
things interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'd like
to add at this point that I hope there will at least be NPC pirate ships who
try to prey on innocent-looking merchant ships, because this will open up one
of the most thrilling of enterprises, and one of the most entertaining of all
nautical story devices: the fake merchant ship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Back in
the glory days of piracy in the Age of Sail, a particularly bad run of piracy
in an area might lead to nearby military ships disguising themselves as
wallowing merchanters. When the pirate moved in for the kill, the
&quot;merchanter&quot; would cast off her disguise and open fire. Not only did
this actually happen, the suspense -- will the ruse work? will the pirate run,
or open fire? -- made it a natural plot device for swashbuckling stories. The
recent movie <i>Master and Commander</i> (adapted from Patrick O'Brian's novel)
is a good example, but when George Lucas revealed the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>'s<i>
</i>concealed nose cannon (as seen near the start of SW:ESB), he was after a
similar effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
superb real-life example of this stratagem occurred during World War I, when
the new German U-boats were tearing through the merchant shipping on which Britain's survival depended. The problem became so acute that the British Navy actually
commissioned an operation to add hidden weapons to small merchant ships. These
&quot;Q-ships,&quot; built from trawlers, schooners, and cargo ships, disguised
their new weapons with false steam funnels, dummy lifeboats, awnings, and even
paint jobs. The Q-boats were designed to lure the U-boats into showing
themselves, then destroying them with their hidden weaponry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It
doesn't always work. By the end of WWI, the score was 193 Q-ships built, 15
U-boats destroyed... and 44 Q-ships lost. But those numbers don't count the
number of U-boats damaged or which failed to attack merchant ships for fear
that they were more deadly than they appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sometimes
just the effort can inspire. If the Space Expansion can allow this kind of
play, it will achieve something worthwhile.</span></p>

SPACELANES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
proposal I saw floated a while back that seemed really clever to me was the
notion of &quot;spacelanes.&quot; Direct routes between major planets would be
safe from piracy, but would offer the lowest-paying freight missions. Indirect
routes between minor planets and moons are somewhat less safe but offer
better-paying freight missions. And everything else is risky but offers the
highest payments for freight missions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Safety&quot;
in this system is provided in a couple of ways. First, direct routes are marked
by buoys; the game simply doesn't permit piracy or &quot;monster&quot; attacks
within these areas. Indirect routes aren't marked, but are patrolled by
randomly-spawning Imperial cruisers (in much the same way that groups of
stormtroopers spawn now for the Imperial Crackdown). If a &quot;Pirate
Flag&quot; or &quot;Pirate&quot; faction points are assigned to any
non-factioned ship that attacks another, then any Imperial patrol ships that
detect a &quot;pirate&quot; will immediately attack it. Likewise, patrol
cruisers will attack any mobs they find along these indirect routes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These
Imperial patrol ships -- since they are Imperial-factioned -- should be open to
attack by Rebel-factioned players. However, it should be noted that destroying
Imperial protection would leave this area of space vulnerable to monsters and
pirates... something that merchant vessels will not appreciate. Long-term this
could and should reduce player support for the Rebellion in this area, but if
it happens too readily it might prove necessary to add an in-game feature that
increases the risks of attacking Imperial patrolcraft -- maybe they're given
the ability to call in rapid reinforcements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
&quot;spacelane&quot; approach gives the player the choice of risk vs. reward
based on his voluntary actions without explicitly making a artificial in-game
distinction between PvE and PvP play. And of course we're just talking about
freight missions here -- it should always be possible for players to buy items
on Planet A for transport to Planet B to sell at a profit. (This is the
distinction between &quot;freight&quot; -- hauling something for someone else
for a predetermined delivery fee -- and &quot;cargo&quot; -- hauling goods you
buy in one place to sell somewhere else on a speculative basis.) A spacelane approach
works just as well for cargo-hauling as for freight-hauling without requiring a
separate system of mission terminals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Between
missions, freight, cargo, passengers, smuggling, and piracy, the Space
Expansion could offer players numerous opportunities to expand their commercial
operations. What will make all these new opportunities work together well will
be if the Space Expansion also includes features that allow players to think of
themselves as &quot;citizens of the galaxy&quot; rather than natives of any
particular planet. (NPCs are the &quot;natives&quot; -- players need to be free
to be roaming heroes.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, the Bazaar currently allows players to see item listings from all
locations on all planets. This is excellent (although the interface -- the
sorting function in particular -- still desperately needs improvement), but it
could be enhanced to better support interplanetary commerce. What if you could
place orders to buy certain items and resources instead of just making offers
to sell? What if you could buy and sell from your ship when it's berthed?</span></p>

would-be Space Rangers: Suppose it was possible to explore the galaxy to find
new places, but trying to find new hyperspace routes was incredibly risky --
would a big finder's fee persuade you to try this? Or would the excitement be
enough? What if you were allowed to uniquely name places you found?</span></p>

how about a crafthall? Not a PA, but an organization necessary for building
large, complex objects (like capital ships) that allowed a controlled
distribution of effort and of rewards? Even better, what if we could create our
own hierarchical organizations, complete with ranks and titles? A multi-person
business syndicate that owns ships and runs freight and cargo operations could
allow players to have all their shipping needs handled by a known corporate
entity (including those little exchanges that the Empire doesn't need to know
about, wink-wink).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Theoretically,
if you can have multiplayer starships you could put darn near anything in space
-- why not a traveling mall? I can imagine the base for the thing being a very
complex structure requiring millions of resources (and credits) to build --
once merchants set up tents there, the builder should probably get a small
percentage of every transaction to defray his building costs (and to profit a
profit incentive to build the thing in the first place).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As far as
that goes, why insist on immobile space stations? Sure, that's easier to do
than a moving platform... but conceptually it's not hard to imagine letting
entire player cities move through space. Just strap big honkin' engines onto
them! These mobile cities might be subject to certain limitations -- they can't
land on a planetary surface, and they can't go into hyperspace. This would mean
that they can't get away from faster ships who might intend harm to them, so
they'd either have to be immune to damage (like ground-based houses), or very
well-protected -- ion cannons, laser turrets, starfighters -- the works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Of course
this isn't an entirely new idea. James Blish wrote a series of four excellent
books collectively titled <i>Cities In Flight</i> about a city -- New York, in fact -- that is cut free from the ground, equipped with faster-than-light
drives, and travels around the galaxy. But even if it's been suggested before,
it would still be amazing to actually play a game that includes something like
this, wouldn't it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>This could be used as sort of an inter-stellar cantina.
This would also work great with your Cargo idea.. but on a much lower scale.
Only a few spaces per player could be rented on a trip. The items would be
transferred into the inventory as the player leaves the ship. Not only that but
the Station will only accept lvls of cargo of medium risk. Anything greater
risks blowing a hole in the ship, infecting the inhabitants with a disease,
cause the people in the med center to go crazy and attack, and so on. This will
allow the newer players to actively take part in the space aspect of the game without
feeling left out due to the lack of credits. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I like
this, too. Absolutely there should be consequences if the material properties
idea is implemented, and if some material isn't handled properly. Why not just
tie a material's storage requirements to some kind of tariff? The more
dangerous it is, the more it costs to bring it aboard for sale. (Naturally, if
you can smuggle it past Customs, you won't pay any kind of fee at all... but if
you're caught with it, you're in Big Trouble.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We do
probably want to be careful that only the person who doesn't handle the stuff
right is penalized for it, though (otherwise it would be possible to grief
other players). OTOH, it might be fun to unleash some kind of minor but general
problem on an entire station/city. Maybe some kind of small, inoffensive, fuzzy
lifeform that breeds prodigiously could get into everything (including the
local grain stores)... hmm....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Another idea if this goes it is docking berths for people
with starfighters... there could be mission terminals that give defense
missions for the station (although escort missions ALWAYS suck), as it is just
a big hunk of metal in space, but this also raises the question of what happens
to the station if the defense is inadequate. Maybe the station is NOT
accessible until damage control teams fix the docking bays. Exiting the station
should never be a problem BUT if you are on the station and a certain amount of
damage is sustained by the ship the players INSIDE should be prepared for a
pirate boarding party. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

like a mobile base to dock my personal starfighter in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
sounds exactly right to me. Before I go too far down this road, however, I'd
need to know more about how ships will land/dock in the Space Expansion.
Depending on how that works, it could turn out to be easy -- or prohibitively
difficult -- to allow ships to dock to mobile platforms. I note, however, that
this capability is <i>required</i> for some starships to operate as carriers...
and as we all know, your basic TIE fighter has to operate out of some kind of
carrier because it has no hyperdrive. So there's a chance this &quot;docking
starfighters to a moving space platform&quot; capability could be included in
the Space Expansion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>will there be any threat out there that all factions
(imp/reb/neutral) must band together to defeat? Like a giant space krayt
dragon? 80 bazillion ham and eats Death Stars for snacks /runs in fear</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

planet and all must try to band together to defeat him? Until the NPC is
defeated or decides to leave shuttle transport can resume as normal. But if the
NPC is still around only passenger ships and starfighters will be able to get
to the planet. Although there is a MUCH greater chance of a pirate encounter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That <i>would</i>
be fun, wouldn't it? The art and programming teams would need to create
appropriate resources, which might be asking a bit much for a one-shot (or even
just two- or three-shot) event -- producers generally prefer to create reusable
objects; you get more bang for your buck that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I
suspect we won't see too many unique, large-scale threats, especially of the
&quot;monster&quot; variety. It might be possible, however, to someday bump
into a really big starship. That might take some programming and
&quot;digiteer&quot; effort, but it could reuse existing art/sound assets.</span></p>

of Jabba's competitors gets hold of a surplus ISD and tries to interdict
Tatooine with it, and Rebels and Imperials have to fight side by side to bring
it down -- would something like that work for you?</span></p>
