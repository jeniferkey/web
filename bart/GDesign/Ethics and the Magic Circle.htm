<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Ethical Behavior Inside
the Magic Circle</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2007/06/25</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I've
heard it proposed recently that &quot;ethics&quot; should apply only to the
players behind the characters in an online game world, and not to the
characters themselves. In other words, characters within a game world should
not be penalized if their players fail to operate those characters according
to a game world's internal standard of right and wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That strikes
me as a remarkably odd position to take. I have a really hard time agreeing
that that's how virtual worlds should be designed, because it denies the
possibility that sometimes there really is a &quot;right thing&quot; to do. Even
if that's not true in our real world, why should virtual world designers not be
allowed to explore it as though it were true, and to impose consequences to
characters in the game world on that basis?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
difference is between a game world in which no character is capable of
appropriately criticizing the behavior of another character, versus one in
which some things that are possible are not considered good behavior. I think
of these competing constructions as &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; versus
&quot;Right and Wrong,&quot; respectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The big
problem I have with asserting that all MMORPGs should be designed according to
the Shades of Gray model -- presumably in the belief that this is more interesting
because it maximizes the freedom of players -- is that it ignores the concept
of the &quot;magic circle.&quot; This is the critical notion that everything
that happens in an imagined world is real to the characters who inhabit and act
in that world -- they exist inside a magic circle. Literary works almost always
follow this pattern. The characters in a book don't talk or act as though they
&quot;know&quot; they're merely fictional characters; they talk and act as
though they're real and so is everyone else in that fictional world. (Comedy
sometimes breaks this rule for humorous effect, but it's only funny <i>because</i>
it's an exception to the rule.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Actors in
a play or a TV show or a movie create the same illusion of reality for their
viewers. That's what being a &quot;good actor&quot; means. Good actors are able
to persuade viewers that they (as their characters) believe in the reality of
the world they're in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
pretense of a magic circle in which unreal things are treated as real is what
Coleridge called the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief.&quot; It enables us
to learn from unreal things by pretending that they are real. By agreeing to
put ourselves inside the magic circle, we become able to understand what happens
there with respect to our real lives. (This is also the power of myth that
Joseph Campbell explored so thoroughly.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Most RPGs
are designed to produce the same effect. By building a world of places
inhabited by characters with apparent intentionality, RPGs create a magic
circle. And when we play that game, we enter the magic circle. Most of us, when
we play a character in such an invented world, choose to behave as though we
ourselves are in that world. We willingly suspend disbelief; we pretend that what
is in this imaginary world is real and manipulate/inhabit our avatar there
accordingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's true
that unlike reading a book or watching a movie, playing an RPG (tabletop or
online) actively involves the real-world person. The experience is no longer passive;
it's interactive. This means that the magic circle is defined in part by what I
do, and by what you do, and by what everybode else does inside the fiction of
the game world. But that doesn't invalidate the magic circle -- it just means
that people have to actively cooperate to maintain the illusion of reality. The
fact that some people don't care to do so doesn't mean that everybody else
should give up and go along with the loss of the imaginary reality. For them,
the rules of the virtual world -- including the ethics of that imagined reality
-- should be treated as though they have real effect on all the characters
within that world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So yes --
outside the game, real-world ethics apply. But inside the game world,
virtual-world ethics are perfectly capable of applying if the world's creators
have designed it to work that way. There is absolutely nothing about virtual
worlds (including MMORPGs) that requires them to be ethically neutral inside
the magic circle. If a world's designers want to impose ethical absolutes that
the characters in the magic circle of that world will be subject to, then they
not only can do so, they should do so if that's necessary for telling a
particular story. If the mythic needs of an imagined world require that some
actions are right and some are wrong and there are tangible consequences in
that world depending on which actions a character takes, then the developers
must implement game functions that &quot;enforce one moral code.&quot; If they
don't, their created world will fail to tell the desired story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Whether <i>we</i>
don't like that particular story is irrelevant. It's not ours to tell. As
consumers we're free to try to persuade game designers to tell our preferred
story, whether of Shades of Gray or Right vs. Wrong, but ultimately the power
of creation is theirs. All we can do is choose which story we want to
experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is it OK
for there to be some RPGs whose developers try to allow characters (as
controlled by their players) to do whatever they want in the game world? Sure. It's
possible to have a Shades of Gray RPG with a magic circle -- within that
circle, might makes right, Thomas Hobbes runs the show, and if you can get away
with it, it's allowable. EVE Online is close to being that kind of game. Not
everyone wants to play such a game, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But not
having to play that kind of game means it must also be OK for designers to
create Right and Wrong worlds in which value judgements on behavior are
possible and even desirable. The magic circle also supports the design of games
in which some the designers of that world impose a particular standard of
ethical action on characters. Not everyone will want to play this kind of game,
either, but again, they shouldn't have to. If such worlds aren't a person's cup
of tea, they can play something else. The existence of worlds where good and
evil can be clearly identified shouldn't be censored because some people are
more comfortable believing that no absolute standard of right and wrong should
exist even in an imaginary world, that everything must always and everywhere be
some shade of gray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Game
designers, as creators of worlds, have the power to make both kinds of game. And
gamers have the freedom to choose which type of magic circle they prefer to
step into through the persona of their character. And that's just how it should
be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
power of creation, not incidentally, is why Richard Bartle insists that
describing game designers as political rulers is less accurate than describing
them as gods.</span></p>
