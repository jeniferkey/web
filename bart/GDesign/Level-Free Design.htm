<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/30</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's
take a look at character levels. Are they really necessary?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
mind character levels per se. They're just a mechanism for accomplishing two
goals:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Minimize
     access to content so that players can't burn through all the content
     immediately.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Provide
     short-, mid-, and long-term goals that players will keep playing to
     attain.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
question is whether there are other mechanisms that offer most of the benefits
of levels with fewer of the problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I think
there might be a way to allow levels that doesn't create the situation where
players grind out levels to rapidly reach the highest level. The key is to
better define differently-focused but content-rich gameplay at low, mid and
high levels, then allow players to choose the level of gameplay they most
enjoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We can
break this down into the following design features:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Gameplay changes as a character climbs the ranks of a profession, moving from
tactical to operational to strategic. Each of these three levels requires a
different way of playing the game, and each is supported with gameplay that's
satisfying at that level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
Advancement is always optional -- if you're at a rank you enjoy, you can choose
to stop advancing and enjoy that content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. With
increasing rank comes more responsibility for insuring the enjoyable gameplay
of others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
result of these changes is twofold. First, gaining levels is no longer an
unalloyed good -- now there's a cost as well as a benefit. As you increase in
level, and your gameplay changes from tactical to operational to strategic, you
become more responsible for the satisfaction of other players at the lower
levels of your chosen profession or class. When power comes with responsibility,
not everyone will choose to chase the &quot;highest&quot; levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Second,
players are explicitly given the power to decide where they feel most
comfortable on the cost/benefit scale. If you enjoy fast-paced squad level
combat with few responsibilities, then you're free to remain playing at the
tactical level. (Some people like being sergeants.) If you feel you know how
group actions ought to be organized but you're not interested in trying to
define high-level goals, then once you've been promoted to an operational role
you can choose to keep playing at that level. And if you yearn to win
large-scale engagements over the long term, and you're willing to accept
responsibility for the consequences to large groups of players of your
decisions, then you can seek and accept promotion to the highest levels which
reward successful strategic gameplay. What level you want to play at should be
your choice; you shouldn't be forced to play at levels you don't enjoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
result of these two effects should be that the burden of having to constantly
chase levels is removed, as is the letdown of wondering &quot;is this all the
high-end content there is?&quot; when the highest level is achieved. By
designing content to satisfy tactical, operational, and strategic gameplay and providing
plenty of content for each type, by designing professions with levels
explicitly defined to provide those three gameplay types, and by allowing
players to choose which gameplay type to enjoy, it seems to me that a lot of
the good that levels offer is retained while a lot of the bad is designed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So do I
have it right? Does this system offer most/any of the benefits of conventional
level systems? Does it avoid most/any of the problems? What would prevent a design
like this from being broadly successful? Could its flaws be corrected by minor
tweaks, or is there some piece that dooms the whole if implemented to any
degree?</span></p>
