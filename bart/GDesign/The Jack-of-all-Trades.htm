&quot;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher
a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a
wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act
alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer,
cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.&quot;

Specialization is for insects.&quot;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>-- from <i>Time Enough for Love</i> by Robert A. Heinlein</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
concept of action has been with me pretty much since the first time I read it
lo, these many years ago. And it's how I prefer to play MMORPGs. I like being
a jack-of-all-trades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note that
when I say "jack-of-all-trades" I do not mean a support class like Healer. That's
not a jack-of-all-trades character; it's a class role character who is directly
aimed at satisfying some developer's role requirement. When I say jack-of-all-trades,
I mean a character who is capable of doing a lot of completely different things
in a game. Maybe not perfectly, maybe not even well, but to be able to do many
things at all is satisfying enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm just
not interested in spending all my waking hours in some futile attempt to be the
&quot;best&quot; at something in a game. I prefer to go my own way, do my own
thing in my own time. Specialization would box me into a particular set of
content -- why would I want to do that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By having
a jack-of-all-trades character, I not only improve my chances of being able to
survive most basic problems the game flings at me, I'm also able to experience
many of the different types of content available in the game. I can never
master any of them -- in fact, being a generalist in a MMORPG pretty much
insures that there's some content (the so-called &quot;high end&quot; or
&quot;endgame&quot; content) that I will never be able to enjoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So? If
it's that intense, I'm not interested. I get enough &quot;intensity&quot; in my
life outside of games; I play games to <i>get away from</i> intense stuff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
jack-of-all-trades approach lets me enjoy a game on my own terms... unless of
course the game insists on stuffing every player into a neat, tidy little class
to fill some developer-determined role, rather offering a rich array of
player-selectable skills so that players can write their own stories. A
class-based game is the mortal enemy of the generalist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So why
don't developers respect gamers who prefer to be a jack-of-all-trades by designing
content for them?</span></p>
