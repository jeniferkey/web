<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Instant Travel Considered Harmful, Part 1</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/12</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Should
some form of teleportation from anywhere be allowed in game-y MMOGs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
an old and painful question. Achievement-oriented players typically object
(loudly) to being &quot;forced&quot; to spend more than a few seconds going
from Point A to Point B no matter how far in space these two points may be
separated. For a lot of these players, the &quot;world&quot; aspect (travelling
should take time) is far less important than the &quot;game&quot; aspect (any
time spent travelling is time wasted because it can't be spent playing the
game).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
other hand, if you let most of your players avoid terrain, some undesirable
things can happen:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>less
     congregating, which is good (less lag), but also bad (less socializing)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>less
     need for traveling merchants (which takes away a valuable economic
     activity)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>less
     need for guides who know an area (again, loss of an economic activity)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>less
     clustering of homes by roads (hurts immersion)</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Insta-travel
is definitely one of those &quot;game&quot; vs. &quot;world&quot; choices. It's
the difference beween &quot;playing in&quot; and &quot;living in&quot; a
virtual world. A metafeature that makes live-in players happy can frustrate
play-in players -- and vice versa -- because it prevents them from playing the
game they think they should be able to play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Either
choice of travel options has consequences for everyone who plays. That's why
you have players &quot;telling each other how to play the game.&quot;
Transportation has consequences for everyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Consider the no-instatravel option. The good thing about expecting all your
players to deal with geography is that it gives the game world texture. By
&quot;texture&quot; I don't just mean physical topography -- I also mean
economic and storytelling depth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When you
define some areas as being harder to travel through than others, and you
carefully regulate the transportation mechanisms available, you immediately
generate a large number and variety of interesting choices for your players.
For example, maybe dangerous places need guides. A player who knows an area
could serve a useful (and possibly lucrative) role guiding other players
through the area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Or
perhaps it's possible to learn specific transportation skills, such as Ferrying
or Short-Range Teleport. Allowing players to learn and use such specialized
skills lets your players help each other. That contributes to an interconnected
and diverse economy, which is usually a Good Thing. (Though it's also true that
such skills need to be of limited scope, and payment models need to be reasoanably
grief-proof. But that's a whole 'nother thread.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
letting your world have geographical texture means more economic opportunities
for your players. It's not just a RP thing; it's about making sure your players
can do a lot more things than just beat up on the local wildlife. That's not
just a worldy feature -- it's about having gameplay options. As such, it
benefits everybody who plays.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. At the
same time, plenty of players just aren't interested in such second-order
effects. If it's too hard to get to the exciting content, they won't play...
and (up to a point) that's bad for everybody who plays, too, because a living,
breathing, dynamic virtual world needs people in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The trick
is to let these folks have the specific thing they want, but cut back on the
negative effects by imposing a cost to this benefit. (This follows what I
believe is an important game design principle: Let players do what they want,
but every action should have a proportionate consequence.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here's
one way to do this. I liked the notion of Summoning from Shadowbane that
RandolM1 described... but with a twist. Allow some players to be able to summon
other players, but give this ability a cost that inversely proportional to how
many people are grouped with the summoner. If you're by yourself, it's going to
cost you a bundle to Summon one other person. But the more people you're
grouped with, the lower the cost per Summons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The value
of this approach is that it enables groups of people who like playing together to
get together with relative ease, but it retains the beneficial effects of
geography in other situations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
probably a lot of other (and better) ways to resolve this particular tension,
but this one seems like it might work... I think!</span></p>
