<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here are
some features an Advanced Search function should have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>DATE
SELECTION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
would return only messages posted between two user-specified dates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The GUI
would consist of two datefields and the appropriate labels. If a date is
entered into the first datefield (preferably from a calendar popup box, which
would eliminate data entry errors), it is used as a starting date for returned
messages -- only those messages posted on or after the given date would be
returned by a search. If a date is entered into the second datefield, it is
used as a final date for returned messages -- only messages between the two
dates (inclusive) would be returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Appropriate
error handling logic would deal with the case of a date entered into the second
datefield but not the first, and the case of a date entered into the second
datefield being earlier than a date entered into the first datefield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>UNREAD
MESSAGE SELECTION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
would return only those messages which the user has not yet read. By itself it
wouldn't be very useful, but in combination with some other specifications it
could help reduce the time spent searching for messages the user might want to
reply to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The GUI
would consist of an &quot;Unread messages only&quot; checkbox. Checking this
box would activate a test that checks whether a message has been read by the
user who performed the search. If the check box is selected (checked), and the
message has not been read by the requesting user, it is returned; otherwise it
is not returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
checkbox would be unchecked by default. A nice-to-have feature would be for
this checkbox to &quot;remember&quot; the user's preference between sessions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
nice touch would be to use the icons displayed next to thread titles on each
forum's header page (the open/closed/arrowed &quot;file folder&quot; icons) in
front of returned messages. This would be another effectively way to tell the
user whether or not she's read a message returned by a search. Currently you
can tell whether a message has been read or not by the brightness of the returned
message's title, but this can be hard to read. The thread icons would make this
information much more obvious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MULTI-WORD
(PHRASE) SEARCHES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
feature would allow searching for multi-word phrases, rather than just
conjunctions of individual words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Currently
if you enter multiple words into the &quot;With all the words&quot; text field
on the Advanced Search page, you get every message that has all of those words
no matter where they occur in the message. Sometimes that's what you want... but
usually it's not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What I'm
looking for is an addition to the Advanced Search GUI that would be structured
as the label &quot;With the exact phrase&quot; and a text field. Anything you
enter into this exact phrase text field would be searched for within messages
as (surprise!) a single phrase exactly as the user entered it, spaces and all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Consider
the current &quot;With all the words&quot; field. If you enter &quot;smart
bomb&quot; into this field, a message that includes the following sentence
would be found: &quot;They made a movie from Get Smart called 'The Nude
Bomb'.&quot; The thread containing this sentence almost certainly has nothing
to do with what the person who entered &quot;smart bomb&quot; was really
looking for because the text entered in the search field is not being treated
as an exact phrase. Any message that has those two words anywhere will be
returned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>With an
exact phrase search, the above sentence would not be found, but &quot;They
dropped a smart bomb down the chimney&quot; would be found, which is probably
part of a thread much more closely related to what the searcher really wanted
to find. This whole-phrase search capability would be a huge help in cutting
down on the number of completely irrelevant messages returned from a multiword
search.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>IMPROVED
RELEVANCE SCORE CALCULATION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
calculation for relevance scores in search results should working properly. If
a message is scored at 99% or 100%, it should be extremely close to what the
user was searching for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Multi-word
searches should have a much broader range of result scores. If I search on
&quot;vehicle speed&quot; in the &quot;With all the words&quot; text field,
messages that have the exact phrase &quot;vehicle speed&quot; ought to be
scored at 100%, while messages with both the word &quot;vehicle&quot; and the
word &quot;speed&quot; separated by other words ought to receive scores
considerably lower than 100%. In an exact phrase search, only messages with the
exact phrase &quot;vehicle speed&quot; somewhere in them would be returned at
all, so every message returned should have a relevance score of 100%.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a
&quot;With zero or more of the words&quot; search, messages containing both of
the submitted words exactly as entered (&quot;vehicle speed&quot;) would be
scored at 100%; messages with both the words separated by other words would be
scored between (say) 50% and 80%; messages with either but not both of the
words would be scored at between 20% and 50%, and messages with neither of the
words would be scored at 0% (and thus would not be returned at all).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
scoring calculation doesn't have to use fuzzy logic (although that would be
effective). A simple distance calculation would be far superior to the
completely dysfunctional scoring system we have now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It also
doesn't need to use <a

codes, although that might be useful as well.</span></p>
