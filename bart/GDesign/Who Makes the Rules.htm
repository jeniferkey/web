<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Who Makes the Rules?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2006/04/24</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Some people have expressed
an opinion that they should be able to powerlevel, or twink, or otherwise get
around the rules of a massively multiplayer game as those rules were designed
by the developers. I don't agree.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>First of all, I'm never
going to agree with the belief that players ought to be able to meta-game the
game. I don't accept the notion that if you're clever enough to find some
exploit or some way to get around the obvious intention of the developer's, it's
OK because you're just being clever. That's nonsense; it's a poor
rationalization for knowingly cheating and there is no reason whatsoever why
developers of massively multiplayer games should tolerate it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Which brings me to my main
point: massively multiplayer online games are not single-player games. If you
(generic you) are playing a solo game and you want to &quot;meta-game&quot; (or
whatever the PC term for cheating is these days), so be it -- you're only
hurting yourself by depriving yourself of the entertainment experience you paid
for. If you don't find the results sufficiently entertaining, don't even think
about complaining to or about the developers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>But while getting around
the rules can be tolerated in a single-player game, it can't be permitted in a
multiplayer game because what you do as a player -- what you're allowed to do
-- directly affects the entertainment experience of other paying customers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>In a massively multiplayer
game, it's not just that &quot;the player's fun comes first&quot; -- it's that
&quot;the fun of all players in the game should be maximized.&quot; That's
sometimes going to mean that what a few people find personally enjoyable has to
be squelched for the good of all the other players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I understand that there's
a contingent of gamers who won't like this, who'll resist any limits to their
power over the game they're paying to play. Too bad. If they feel that way,
it's because they don't comprehend that what they're paying for isn't a
single-player game, that what they're allowed to do affects how entertaining
the game is for other players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The idea that a few
players ought to be able to get around the entertainment experience as designed
is bogus in a mass entertainment medium. To try to insure that the most
participants are getting their entertainment dollar's worth, the designer --
not players -- must control the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>How long would Vegas last
if some players could &quot;twink&quot; their buddies on the blackjack table
with face cards, or be &quot;powerleveled&quot; on the roulette wheel with
knowledge of where the ball will land?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>For mass entertainment
games, the designer has to be in control of the game, or it stops being
entertaining for the masses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Of course game designers
are not always right. They're people, too, and as such are more than capable of
making lousy (i.e., not-fun) design decisions. But massively multiplayer game
designers being fallible and limited does not justify players taking the law
into their own hands, because:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Most players aren't
     thinking of others, but only of themselves.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Most players don't have
     as much massively multiplayer game design experience as even fallible
     developers.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Most players don't have
     adequate big-picture or behind-the-scenes knowledge about a specific game.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>In short, most players
aren't objective, they aren't experienced, and they aren't informed. The
designers may not be perfect at those things, either, but they'll still be
better at them than most players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Nor would it be OK to cede
control to the very small number of entertainment consumers who are objective,
experienced and informed. All that does is create class warfare between the
have and the have-nots, blurring the lines of responsibility for providing
enjoyable gameplay content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>And blurred responsibility
never, ever works out well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Thus I conclude that both
the right and the responsibility for controlling a mass gameplay experience
must clearly reside with the developers, not the players. Ceding either the
right or responsibility will make any mass entertainment product less entertaining
than it should and could be. And that ultimately hurts us all, producers and
consumers alike.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Game designers are by no
means perfect, but it's still their job to determine how a massively
multiplayer game should work -- not the players'.</span></p>
