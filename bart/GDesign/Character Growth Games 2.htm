<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/03/07</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As I
observed in <A HREF="Character Growth Games 1.htm">Character Growth Games 1</A>,
I don't accept the assumption (and that's all it is so far) that players only like
character advancement games. Maybe it is true, but how do we know? Where are the
alternative games that would give us some evidence as to whether this assumption is
correct or not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In fact,
I think there are reasons to believe that character advancement games have some
innate flaws, and thus that alternatives could prove to be fun, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Designing
a game to have character advancement automatically means that players spend the
first part of their in-game lives levelling up just so they can get to the end
game which, theoretically, is where the real fun of a game is. Instead of
playing the fun part of the game, players spend weeks or months training to get
to the fun. Instead of implementing the fun content, developers spend weeks and
months implementing character advancement content that players feel they have
to grind through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why do we
accept this state of affairs as &quot;what players really want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here's a
concept I've been working on. Let players choose from among a large number of
skills when they create their character... and that's it. When you're done
creating your character, you're ready to play the game. No leveling, no
grinding, no &quot;low-level&quot; content -- it's all end game from the moment
you exit character creation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This does
not imply that &quot;everyone can do everything.&quot; Because there are
skills, because different skills favor different gameplay styles and thus
appeal to different kinds of players, and because not everyone will choose the
same skills, some characters will be better than others at performing certain
tasks. A character with a lot of combat skills won't be as good at building
houses as a character with crafting skills; a crafter won't be as good at
making money as a character who learned financial skills; and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Furthermore,
content doesn't have to be graded by level. It can also vary according to how
hard it is to reach through travel, or by how many players (and how many unique
skills) are typically needed to complete that content. Again, a game without
character advancement does not imply that every character can take on all
content. It just means you don't have to spend time trying to open up the
content that's already been designed for you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Not
having skill-based character advancement also doesn't mean it's impossible to
improve a character over time. For combat players, there are all kinds of
rewards that don't vastly increase the power of veteran players over new
players: perks like rank, badges, leader boards. For the other type of
competitive player -- economic players -- there's the other big form of improvement:
money. Even if there aren't crazy things to buy, players will still collect
money as a form of keeping score.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
it's possible to have skill advancement even in a non-advancement game... but
the only way to make this work is if each improvement comes with additional
responsibility for helping other players have fun. When the rewards for
collecting XP are nothing but more power (as in current character advancement
games), everybody goes for advancement. When a reward is all benefit and no cost,
everyone will try to take that benefit. Why not? Except that this leads to a
game full of cookie-cutter characters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Instead,
I believe every reward should come with strings attached. In particular,
advancing in some level such as rank should impose new and larger
responsibilities. This means treating tactical gameplay as distinct from
operational gameplay, and operational gameplay as different from strategic
gameplay. Each higher level should require more abstract thinking and more time
spent coordinating the gameplay of other players instead of just being
concerned with one's own immediate gratification.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
requires one additional feature: players must be free to choose not to advance.
If you like pedal-to-the-metal, full-tilt-boogie combat action, there's no
reason why a game should force you to stop playing at that tactical level game
just because you &quot;have to&quot; advance in level. If you're willing to
take on the logistical and long-range planning headaches that go with
strategic-level gameplay, then you're free to advance to seek those challenges,
but if you like being a sergeant, you ought to be able to stay a sergeant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
summary, yes, character advancement is a familiar model, and players do like to
feel that their characters are becoming more powerful. But character
advancement also imposes some effects that aren't much fun, like having to
spend weeks grinding to level up before you can start enjoying the deepest
content. On balance, I believe a game that lets you create a complete character
has at least an equal chance of success as character advancement games, and I
look forward to some enterprising developer giving this idea a shot.</span></p>
