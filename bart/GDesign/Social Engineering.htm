<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/05/25</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What is
this antipathy to &quot;social engineering&quot; that keeps cropping up in
discussions?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If we're
talking about real life, I'm with you. The belief that you can perfect human
beings is responsible for more killing of humans by other humans than anything
else in our history. Attempts to impose this perfection by any means, including
the design of social structures into which people must be forced for their own
good, needs to be resisted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And if
we're talking about sandboxes like There or Second Life, I'm also with you. One
of the points of these games is emergent gameplay; to stick a finger on the
scales by imposing certain favored social behaviors would be to reduce the
value of the sandbox.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But a
MMORPG is neither real life nor a sandbox. I like 'em to be simulations, but I
also like 'em to be games.And if it's a game, then there is no alternative to
designing social structures -- you <i>must</i> do this, you <i>have</i> to
consciously define punishments and rewards to encourage or discourage specific
social behaviors or it's not a multiplayer game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
said that, I certainly agree that it's best not to design social structures
that force people to interact, or that manipulate players for the amusement of
the developers or others. Players should be free to choose. Take away player
control over their actions and you're basically treating people like lab rats.
Yuk. But there still need to be consequences, and developers still need to be
able to encourage friendly social interaction (since that's kind of the point
of &quot;massively multiplayer online game&quot;).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If forced
interaction is what you mean by &quot;social engineering,&quot; then I agree --
that's bad juju. But the fundamental idea of the developers setting up sticks
and carrots to penalize or promote specific player behaviors, and in particular
to encourage (not force, but encourage) friendly interaction between players...
I don't agree with hammering on that, because you can't <i>not</i> do it and
still offer a game that multiple people can happily play together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So is
everybody rolling their eyes and going, &quot;Well, duh!&quot; or is there a
real distinction worth considering here?</span></p>
