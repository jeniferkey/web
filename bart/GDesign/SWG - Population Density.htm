<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's
focus on one of the most obvious approaches to increasing population density:
Merging the servers to generate an increased sense of activity within the game
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
two issues here that could generate forum discussion for years:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. The
galaxies (in particular, NPC cities) don't feel as &quot;alive&quot; as they
did when SWG launched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
just simple truth. Those of us fortunate enough to have been around for the
first few weeks after SWG launched remember what it was like: every NPC town,
no matter how small, was a buzzing beehive of activity. Even the outposts on
the &quot;adventure planets&quot; had plenty of explorers, while every town on
Naboo, Corellia, and Tatooine was full of players seeing the sights, learning
the systems, and interacting with each other (and with NPCs).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If
anything, many places felt too crowded!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
no longer the case. For many months now, and despite the addition of various
combat-only dungeons, Jump to Lightspeed, the Combat Upgrade, and Rage of the
Wookiees, the number of players to be seen has dropped precipitously. In many
places, it's possible to go for weeks without ever seeing a blue dot on your
radar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
isn't necessarily due to anything SOE did &quot;wrong.&quot; SWG attracted a
lot of people when it launched simply because it was an online Star Wars game;
there was no way it (or any other game) could have retained all those players
no matter how great it was. (Could it have been better? I think so, but that's
debatable.) The numbers when SWG launched were not sustainable; some reduction
in the number of players wandering around was inevitable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And
yet... many places have felt awfully empty for a long time now. And that just
doesn't seem right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
Although &quot;server consolidation&quot; is a fairly popular idea for
restoring that feeling of activity, it has some serious issues that would have
to be addressed, and there are other alternatives that could be considered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The main
problem with consolidation is fairness to those on the servers that get closed
down and whose characters are moved to another server. (There's also a question
of fairness to those players on the server that suddenly gets a whole bunch of
new players -- Merchants might not be happy about the additional competition
for sales, for example. But these problems are, I think it's fair to say,
relatively minor compared to those of the folks who get displaced.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let me
mention a few examples. (I'll use myself in some of these examples, but that's
only because I'm familiar with these issues -- they're not just about me;
they're intended to be representative of what would happen to numerous people.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>a.
Because I've had the Merchant Advertising 3 skill for a while, as well as a
shop and vendors, I happen to have the two top slots for Equipment vendors on
the Planetary Map listing of vendors for Radiant/Naboo. I don't get many sales
because of this, but I do get some, and I'd suffer financially if I didn't get
those sales.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What happens
if Radiant gets shut down and all its characters have to move elsewhere?
Suppose I move to Kettemoor/Naboo -- do I get the top two Equipment vendor
slots on Naboo's planetary map? If so, how is that fair to the person who held
those two slots on Kettemoor before I showed up? If not, how is that fair to
me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
general, what happens to the people who've maintained vendors and Advertising 3
long enough to gain those high-level Planetary Map slots in other sales
categories on the various planets? How do you divide an indivisible asset in a
way that's fair to everyone?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>b. Many
months ago (before vehicles/mounts) I picked out a nice place for a house and
set up shop. It was on a long spit of land between two bodies of water so that
players running between Theed and Keren would be likely to pass by my shop. The
location isn't as meaningful as a sales tool now that players don't have to run
everywhere, but it's still got a very nice view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If I'm
forced to move to another server, what happens if there's already a house on
the new server where mine was on my old server? What about the players who
jumped on prime spots near Theed and Coronet, and who rely on those locations
for business?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>How is it
right for a player to be &quot;penalized&quot; for having the bad luck to
choose a server that gets marked for closure? (And to anyone who shrugs and
says &quot;Why should I care what happens to merchants?&quot;: when the
crafters and merchants quit playing because they lose the perks they worked to
gain, who's going to make and sell you that 133t gear you had your eye on at a
price you can afford?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>c. I'm
not a Tailor, but suppose I were. Tailors depend on being able to customize
colors of clothing. So they often need to create each type of clothing in
multiple color styles to increase their chances of making a sale. This can
result in Tailors having several thousands of units of product on their vendors
at a time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Question:
How do you move thousands of items to another server? If players must have all
their possessions in their inventory in order to to be transferred, there's no
way many players will be able to retain all their existing stock. If, on the
other hand, the transfer system allows players to move entire houses full of
vendors stuffed with items, how does the system know where to place those
houses on the new server? Even if it's possible to develop code to handle this
situation, is designing and writing that code really what SWG's programmers
should be doing with their time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
just a small peek at the kinds of questions that would need to have answers
before a server consolidation could happen. In fact, I'll bet I'm not even
mentioning the hardest questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Which
leads me to wonder: although we agree that the galaxies were more fun when they
were more crowded, is there some way other than server consolidation that we
could make our existing galaxies seem more active? Are there any other ways to
reach that goal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well, the
best way is easy to say: attract and retain more players! No doubt SOE itself would
prefer this solution. :smileyvery-happy: But it's probably not something we
should count on being able to achieve, even if we knew exactly how to do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So what
are some other possibilities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Make
the planets smaller.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
would work in the same way that decreasing the volume of a gas (while holding
its temperature constant) increases its pressure. But it's probably not a
realistic option, as it runs into the same kind of &quot;where would stuff
go?&quot; questions that server consolidation generates. Plus it's nice
occasionally to be able to go where there's not a crush of people; it would be
best if we could retain that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. Allow
players to &quot;rent apartments&quot; in NPC cities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This has been
a very popular suggestion virtually since SWG launched. It would almost
certainly increase player activity in NPC cities, which is what we want. On the
other hand, unless these &quot;apartments&quot; had to be crafted by
Architects, the market for houses would be severely damaged. And if it were
possible to have vendors inside an NPC city apartment, the Architects might
never sell another house at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
also the point that this system wouldn't do anything to promote living in the
smaller NPC cities -- there'd probably be massive lag due to every player not
currently in a player city trying to move into Theed, Coronet, or
Anchorhead/Mos Eisley.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then
there's that issue of player cities -- what happens to them if NPC apartments
become available? If you think there are too many player cities, then you might
like the idea of NPC apartments... but what if being part of a player city is
important to you? (And I don't just mean those who enjoy the Politician
profession.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
there's the bottom line: is an NPC city &quot;apartment&quot; even possible
technically? The occasional comments from various developers over the past
couple of years suggest that it's not. For whatever reason, this idea seems to
be a non-starter with the developers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. Add
content to NPC cities that makes it attractive to spend long amounts of time
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
personally like this approach -- it's more of a carrot than a stick, and it
offers the opportunity to the developers to add new content that would directly
increase the amount of socialization and community in the game. That would be a
Good Thing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>a. One
possibility that you and I have both suggested is Player Arenas. Everybody wins
with this one: combat players get to bash each others' brains out in a socially
sanctioned way (as opposed to randomly dueling in the street); enterprising
players could run betting parlors; and everybody else gets to enjoy a spectacle
(and maybe make a little money in the process). If we wanted to get silly we
could even establish a &quot;circuit&quot; system on each planet that has
arenas: In order to be allowed to compete in the Mos Eisley arena, say, you'd
first have to win 50% of your matches (minimum of 25 matches) in the Bestine
arena, and to compete there you'd have to win 33% of your matches (minimum of
10 matches) in any other arena on Tatooine. You could even have different rules
per each arena, or per planet -- maybe gentle Naboo only allows arena fights to
incapacitation, while savage Tatooine permits deathblows (and bigger stakes!
/evilgrin).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>b.
Another possibility for increasing player presence in NPC cities would be to
offer special benefits to using city facilities. Maybe public crafting stations
give a bonus to assembly or experimentation that you can't get using a private
crafting station -- how fast would the crafters run to the NPC cities for every
item that didn't require a private crafting station or benefit from being
cranked out in a factory? You could even give different cities different
specialties -- maybe Kor Vella is a great place to make ranged weapon powerups;
maybe Moenia is the place to be if you want to make musical instruments; maybe
the galaxy's best medicines are crafted in Anchorhead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>c. What
about making NPCs themselves more interesting? Currently they either stand
around by themselves waiting to give a mission, or stand &quot;talking&quot;
with another NPC (and are thus just scenery), or walk randomly about (like RSF
troops or droids). This isn't wrong, exactly... but it does seem like a waste
of good NPC code. Heck, they don't even run to or away from a gunfight that
erupts just around the corner! Why don't NPCs &quot;hear&quot; better?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the more entertaining NPC things I've seen recently was a Corellian CorSec
operative attacking a police officer. Every time the officer respawned, the
CorSec operative would return to attack again. I figured this was a bug... but
what an interesting bug! &quot;Why,&quot; I wondered, &quot;would these
officials be attacking each other? What's the story here?&quot; Why doesn't
general faction (i.e., not Rebel/Imperial faction) play as much of a role
between NPCs as it does between players and NPCs? Why aren't NPCs doing more
interesting things to and with each other, just like PCs do? Aren't there
supposed to be a million stories in the naked city? Where are those stories?
Why aren't they happening all the time, and just begging players to get
involved in those local affairs? Why don't NPCs seem to have goals that they
actively pursue and that players could become a part of, rather than being
isolated mission-givers? The Combat Upgrade is said to have improved combat
AI... what about AI improvements for non-combatant NPCs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>d. As a
final suggestion along those lines, I like the idea of there being &quot;bad
parts of town,&quot; but let's be fair to players -- always give them a way to
go around such places, and give them tools for seeing where these places are.
In addition to not instaspawning aggro'ing NPCs on top of CL1 players, how
about this: Rather than coloring everything <b><span style='color:lime'>green</span></b>
on the overhead map, mark the &quot;bad&quot; parts of town in <b><span
style='color:red'>red</span></b>. So, you're new to town and you want to know
where the &quot;no-go&quot; zones are? Simple: Bring up your overhead map with
&quot;M&quot; or &quot;Ctrl-M&quot; -- if you're in a red-colored area, turn
around and start running because you're about to get jumped. (On the other
hand, if you're looking for a little combat action, the nearest red area may be
exactly where you want to go!) And we can improve on this idea even further:
maybe the bad part of town is where the less savory mission-giving NPCs live --
if your tastes run to smuggling, spying, theft, skullduggery and mayhem of
various types, this is where you'd need to go to find the NPCs who give those
kinds of missions.</span></p>
