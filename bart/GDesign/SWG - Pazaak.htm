<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As I
noted in a message over in the Core Systems forum, I finally broke down and
paid the bucks for Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR). It's a good game, but
the specific suggestion I'd like to make is that SWG implement Pazaak as
quickly as possible -- this minigame is just too much fun, too good a fit into
the Star Wars universe, and too useful as a new SWG feature. (For example, it
would help prove that &quot;content&quot; doesn't just mean
&quot;dungeons.&quot; Ahem.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For those
who haven't yet played KOTOR, this is a card game between two players. (It's
only necessary to have a third person if trying to implement Pazaak in SWG
without SWG itself offering a mechanism for dealing cards.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
general rules for Pazaak are roughly as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>cards
     in the standard deck are numbered 1 through 10 </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the
     deck can be considered infinite (there are always more cards) </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>players
     agree to wager some amount of cash before a match begins </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>matches
     consist of three sets </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>to play
     a set: </span></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>players
      begin taking turns turning over one deck card each </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the
      value of a deck card turned over is added to that player's point total </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(for
      SWG, the player who goes first in a set should be randomly selected) </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>each
      player may optionally play a private &quot;hand card&quot; (added to that
      player's total) </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>each
      player starts a match with four hand cards from a personal side deck </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>when a
      hand card is played, it is gone for the remainder of the match </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>after
      taking a deck card (and possibly a hand card), each player must choose
      to: </span></li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;end
       turn&quot; (agree to take another deck card next turn) </span></li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;stand&quot;
       (take no more deck or hand cards for the rest of the set)</span></li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>if a
      player ever has 20 points showing, he automatically stands </span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>players
      continue taking turns until one of the following happens: </span></li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>one
       player stands or ends a turn with 21 or more points </span></li>
   <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
    <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the
        other player wins the set</span></li>
   </ul>
   <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>both
       players stand </span></li>
   <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
    <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the
        player with more points showing wins the set </span></li>
    <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>if
        both players are tied, another set is started and played</span></li>
   </ul>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the
     first player to win three sets wins the match and play ends</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This by
itself would be interesting, but there are a couple of clever twists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First of
all, you carry your own personal Pazaak cards as inventory items. When a Pazaak
match starts, you choose ten of your personal cards for a side deck, out of
which four cards are randomly chosen as your hand cards (which the other player
can't see). When you start playing KOTOR you have ten personal cards to choose
from -- 2 each of cards valued at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. So you start with all ten
of these cards as your side deck, out of which the game might randomly choose
1, 3, 3, and 4 as hand cards for use during a match.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
second twist (which really gives Pazaak its flavor) is that you can add new
personal cards to your inventory that have negative numbers. Having a hand card
with negative points means that if you go over 20 you can play one of these
negative cards and go back to 20 or less, allowing you to stay in the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, let's say I've got a hand card of -2. I'm currently showing 14 points,
and I turn over a deck card. It's an eight, which gives me a total of 22
points. If I stand now, the other player will win because I've got 21 or more
points showing. Instead, I additionally play my -2 hand card -- this brings my
total back down to 20, allowing me to stay in the set (and possibly win it).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even
better than negative cards are some cards which let you choose whether their
numeric value is positive or negative when you play it. In this way a card
that's plus-or-minus-2 could get you to 20 whether you have 18 or 22 showing.
Part of your goal in being a Pazaak player is to build a side deck consisting
of nothing but plus/minus cards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>BUT...
you don't start KOTOR with these negative or plus/minus cards -- you have to
find these cards to add them to your inventory. Then you can gradually replace
the cards in your starting side with these improved cards. They turn up as
loot, or in various containers, or can be bought from various vendors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
tactics of Pazaak thus lie in knowing:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>which
     cards to choose for the ten in your side deck </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>when to
     stand vs. when to turn over another card </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>when to
     play one of the four cards in your private deck</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It seems
to me that this mini-game would make an excellent addition to SWG. It's already
part of the Star Wars canon; it's already part of the LucasArts franchise (so
no ownership issues); it would be another way for players to interact; it could
move large quantities of money around (especially if no hard limit was set on
wagers ;-); and Pazaak cards would make great loot as long as they remained
sufficiently rare.</span></p>
