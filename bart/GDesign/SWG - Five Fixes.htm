<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2004/10/16</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To start
with, every suggestion I make is intended to help move SWG toward better
achieving the following goals:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Every
     player should always be able to find something interesting/rewarding to
     do.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
     meaningfulness -- and consequences -- of a player's actions in the game
     world should increase with that player's power.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Gamers
     and MMOG industry insiders alike should be able to point to SWG as an
     example of how to develop and operate a mass-market online game service.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Achieve
those goals, and you will have an entertainment product that satisfies
everyone: more happy players means more revenue for SOE/LEC. Everybody wins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So in no
particular order, here are five specific actions that SOE can take with SWG to
achieve these goals:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>1. Players must feel they play a meaningful role in an exciting
story set in the Star Wars universe.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the hardest issues all MMOGs face is figuring out the right balance between
gameplay and story. Some online games can focus on pure DOOM-like gameplay,
while others are able to focus on pure storytelling... but SWG can't afford to
dismiss either of these two entertainment modes. SWG requires both strong
gameplay <i>and</i> a compelling story within which the gameplay moves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG is an
online game, so of course gameplay (skills, weapons/armor/tools, PvE, PvP,
etc.) is required. SWG does a fairly good job here, and will be even more
effective once JtL ships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But it's
also true that SWG is based on George Lucas's adventure movies, which owe their
popularity in large part to the interesting story Lucas tells and the fascinating
characters through whom that story is told. Players of a Star Wars-based game
absolutely expect to be participants in story content that brings the Star Wars
universe to life for them, and right now SWG is not delivering the story
content necessary to maintain the Lucas legacy of telling an enthralling story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Furthermore,
looked at purely as a MMOG, the story is what keeps players returning to the
gameplay. Players will always be able to race through gameplay content faster
than SOE developers can craft it -- what keeps players coming back to that
gameplay is the story in which the gameplay is set. The story is what gives the
gameplay meaning. Story is what tells players that their game actions have
purpose and value beyond merely grinding to the top of some pyramid. Story is
what keeps players coming back to the game to reprise content they've already
seen. In short, gameplay attracts new subscriptions, but story is what
maintains subscriptions over the long term. If you want your game to endure, you
need story. And in the case of SWG, you need something even more specific: you
need <i>Star Wars</i> stories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ways must
be found to give players the feeling that they are part of a real Star Wars
story. How do we do that? Simple: let players make choices, and let there be
real consequences in the game world for those choices. When consequences
individually and in the aggregate clearly affect the player's part in some
greater storyline in the Star Wars universe, when player actions can be seen to
have real meaning within the game world, you've made the player part of a Star
Wars adventure that they'll recall with pleasure for years to come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A really
satisfying adventure story is full of hard choices expressed through exciting
actions, where a person's character is revealed through the choices they make
and the sides they take. Star Wars succeeded because it told that kind of
powerful and exciting story. If SWG doesn't fulfill its destiny as a son of
Star Wars, then it will fail to achieve its full potential as a key component
of the Star Wars saga. And that would be a shame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>2. Individual quests/missions must be integrated into a larger,
fully connected activity structure.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here's a
specific suggestion: Instead of thousands of completely disconnected missions
and unrelated quests, these NPC-directed player activities ought to be
integrated into a set of overarching Star Wars-specific stories, which
themselves are integrated into the full Star Wars saga as we know it though the
movies and books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Early/easy
missions can seem to be unconnected. It's appropriate for new players to see
only the most local effects of their actions. But as players advance in power,
they should begin to realize that what appeared to be unconnected requests were
really individual parts of something much larger going on, and that
participating in these missions makes the player a part of the larger story.
Missions to kill off bandits in a particular area could turn out to be
preliminary action for establishing a secret Rebel base secure from prying
eyes, and a player who realizes this should have to decide whether he wants to
support that storyline or not. Missions to craft specialized components could
turn out to be an attempt by the Empire to flood the market in a Rebel-occupied
area with spare parts to destabilize the local economy, or to generate a spare
parts inventory for the construction of a new factory for crafting star
destroyers. Again, a player who suddenly comes to understand the role she is
playing in a larger world has the chance to become more connected to that
world... and that's how you retain paying customers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These
realizations that players have about the local meaning of what they've been
doing should eventually begin to open up larger-scale missions -- let's call them
quests. Quests should be riskier than than the initial missions, and should
require the player to make more intense choices -- do you help those who need
it even when it could injure you or your friends? Or do you put your personal
desires above everything, even if it means abandoning the larger effort to the
&quot;bad guys?&quot; The more quests you take, the more you learn about the
grand storyline in which those quests are related, and the more you learn, the
better your odds putting the pieces together to succeed at those quests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These
quests, if successful, should lead to the third and highest level of mission,
the adventure. Taking on an adventure means you have entered the part of the
story that reveals the global challenge behind all the local stories. Succeeding
in an adventure should not be about what gear a player has -- it should depend
on his or her choices when confronted by hard decisions. Success, in fact,
should not necessarily mean living or dying -- maybe it's about realizing who
your character really is. Just as Luke and Han and Lando had to make ultimate
choices about the kinds of persons they really were when they finally
understood what was at stake, so should the player of SWG be able to reach a
point of understanding a story enough to work with other players to
successfully determine the outcome of a major Star Wars story, and that outcome
should have a major impact on the character's game life. As in all great
literature, the outer struggle should be a mirror for the inner journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
a practical note on structure: quests and adventures ought to come in parts. To
get to Part H, you need to have completed Parts C and G, each of which depends
in turn on having completed Parts A and B, and Parts D and E and F,
respectively. Developers should also consider making some parts of a multi-part
quest or adventure depend on having certain skills, not all of which any one
player could have at one time. This would encourage either grouping or trying
new skills over a long time, both of which are positive acts within SWG. As a
nice bonus to the gameplay value of multi-part quests and adventures,
structuring stories as pieces also allows developers to organize
missions/quests/adventures as structured segments of coherent storylines --
basically it's a way to sequence the acts and scenes of a story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ultimately
the right to be a part of an adventure, a major story set within the Star Wars
saga, ought to have to be earned by good story-based gameplay. Success should
depend not on grinding, nor on reading &quot;The Answer&quot; to some static
NPC question from a Stratics or Allakhazam database, nor on massed brute force
or exploiting game holes, nor on buying uber armor/weapons, but on a
demonstrated willingness to make tough choices and accept the consequences of
those choices within the game world and within the big story in which that
player chooses to play a part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now <i>that</i>
would make missions satisfying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>3. &quot;Hero&quot; NPCs from the movies and books must be more
active in the game world.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
component of rewarding players for participating in the story part of the game
would be the chance to interact with a character or characters from the Star
Wars movies and books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
developers deserve some credit for realizing that the characters in Star Wars
media are a major draw in a game based on the Star Wars universe, and for
including these characters into SWG gameplay. But I think it's fair to say that
using these &quot;hero&quot; NPCs (by which I mean named good guys and bad
guys) as mere static mission-givers severely underestimates their value in
generating the sense in players of being part of a big Star Wars story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let
players doing missions meet minor players in the saga; let players doing quests
meet important secondary characters; and let players taking on an adventure
meet the major &quot;leads.&quot; If I take a mission to craft a power
regulator for a Y-wing shield generator, maybe 1 in 20 times I'll bump into
Nien Numb or some other relevant but minor character. Other kinds of missions
would occasionally lead to meeting other minor characters relevant to those
kinds of activities, and quests and adventures should offer the chance to
encounter (or be summoned by!) even more powerful movie/book characters
appropriate to the player's choices.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This would
serve two important goals. First, it's a good way to guide players toward the
information they need to succeed at the next level of missions -- it's a way to
help tell the current story. Second, these characters should be used as rewards
for long-term participation in the game. Serve the Rebellion effectively, and
maybe Admiral Ackbar commends you... fail at too many missions of high
importance to the Emperor, and maybe Darth Vader shows up to extract an
&quot;apology&quot; from you. Even neutrals should be able to get into the act:
&quot;good&quot; neutrals ought to be pushed by both Empire and Rebellion to
join up, while neutrals of questionable virtue should be able to sign on with
one of several competing crime syndicates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
player access to hero characters ought to be much more strictly rationed than
is currently allowed. As a starting player, I shouldn't be able to go talk to
Princess Leia just because I read her static address from some offsite game
forum -- I ought to have to earn the right to interact with her. There
definitely need to be rewards of this type to motivate low-level players, but
rewards should always be commensurate with risk: meeting Luke or Vader ought to
be <i>very</i> hard to do, but these meetings should make a huge difference in
a character's life when achieved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>4. &quot;Content&quot; must include non-combat players.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG will
be a stronger, more long-lasting game if it respects players with different
playstyles. Yes, for business reasons it's necessary to be seen servicing
combat-oriented players, but it is also absolutely necessary to show some
respect to players with more creative or commercial or social interests. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where are
the &quot;dungeons&quot; for crafters? Where's the equivalent of a Hermit Quest
for entertainers? Where's anything like Jabba's themepark or Nym's themepark or
the Imperial or Rebel themeparks for merchants? When will medics get any
content even remotely resembling the scope of the Corellian Corvette or
Deathwatch Bunker?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
the one aspect of SWG in which I am the most disappointed. SWG's developers
began with an interesting crafting system, a dynamic player economy, and a
meaningful role for entertainers, and those were good things... but since
launch all three of these major game areas have been badly neglected except in
minor bugfix or profession-specific ways. There have been virtually no broad,
Core Systems-oriented enhancements for players with these gameplay styles since
SWG launched, and that is just wrong. It's disrespectful to the many players
who enjoy crafting and commerce and social gameplay to be so badly ignored when
major enhancements are doled out, and that disrespect translates directly into
the business problem of loss of revenue when these players decide that SWG
doesn't want them and they leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG is
gradually bleeding away its long-term player base because it has failed and
continues to fail to recognize the value of these kinds of players to long-term
sustainment of a mass-market MMOG. If this lack of respect for non-combat
players continues, then once the initial spike of subscriptions for JtL passes,
SWG will be dead within two years. And it will be dead because its long-term
players -- the crafters and merchants and entertainers -- will have left SWG
for other MMOGs (such as Second Life) that show more respect for their
preferred playstyles by offering content appropriate for those playstyles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>5. The software development process must improve to reduce the
number of bugs introduced with changes.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
believe I need to say much here. We all know how important it is in the
intensely competitive MMOG industry to be perceived as &quot;fun,&quot; which
means two things: plenty of content, and few bugs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Content
I've addressed above... but bugs have already nearly killed the perception of
SWG as fun. SOE's software development process <i>must</i> be improved, or even
JtL will not be enough to save this game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
technical means by which bug rates can be reduced are not complicated or
obscure; a Google search on &quot;CMMI SEI&quot; will show you any number of
organizations that will be delighted to explain how to achieve and sustain an
effective software development process, which would make a huge dent in the
number of bugs unleashed on players. The harder part is convincing SOE
management to embrace this level of professional commercial software
development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Doing it
right means being able to say &quot;no.&quot; As in, &quot;no, this feature has
not been adequately tested and we will not include it in the next hotfix.&quot;
As in, &quot;No, all of our source code reviewers have not fully studied these
changes, and we will not include them in the next hotfix.&quot; Being able to
say no to your boss is hard (trust me on this). But having to explain to your
boss why he won't be getting a bonus because too many players refused to
resubscribe to a buggy game is even harder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Requirements
reviews; preliminary and critical design reviews; peer review (including
documentation); QA testing, source code and documentation configuration
management -- every one of these steps slows down your development process...
and every one of these steps helps insure that the code you do turn over
doesn't break. SOE is doing some of these, but it needs to give them teeth so
that everyone on the development team from the most junior coder to the Senior
Producer (including LucasArts producers) insists that they be respected even
when doing so affects the release schedule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Achieve
that in a highly complex software product like SWG, and SOE can be acknowledged
by its subscribing customers and entertainment industry peers for how it
respects its customers by giving them a bulletproof product.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I realize
this is probably more text than you were looking for, KS. But please bear in
mind that this is the Core Systems forum -- while it's a reasonable place to
point out very specific game features to modify, it's also the appropriate
place to think about SWG game systems at a high level. Sometimes that means
getting a little &quot;deep&quot;; it means stepping back from specific
features to ask ourselves, &quot;What are these features <i>for</i>? What's the
overall goal we're trying to achieve?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
what my five suggestions are intended to do, and why I spoke on each of them at
some length. I hope they provoke some discussion -- we ought to be bashing
these kinds of ideas around in this forum!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But as I
mentioned at the start of this novel, your request for our Top Five
&quot;Issues&quot; seemed to be very focused on asking for suggestions to fix
problems in existing features, rather than for ideas for broad enhancements for
new features. While fixing problems is certainly important, I'd hate to think
that a Core Systems Top Five list would <i>only</i> be about fixing problems!
Part of having a Core Systems mindset is being creative in coming up with new
features that would do a lot to make SWG as a whole a more entertaining game --
a good Top Five list ought to include those kinds of &quot;cool new
feature&quot; suggestions, too.</span></p>
