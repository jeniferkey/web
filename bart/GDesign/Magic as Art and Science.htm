<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's an old
question, but it's still a good one: When developing a concept of magic for a
work of fantasy (whether a book or a game), should it be presented as a form of
science with consistent laws? Or should it be described as an ineffable thing
that simply works because it does?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In other
words, should magic be represented as a science or as an art?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
fifty years ago, C.P. Snow (<i>The Two Cultures</i>) described a widening gulf
between the artistic and scientific conceptions of the world. We don't seem
today to be any closer to resolving that tension. I have trouble deciding it
for myself (in general, and in how magic is implemented in computer games)
because I can see both sides too well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
one hand I'm one of those crazy INTP &quot;Architect&quot; <a
href="http://keirsey.com/personality/ntip.html">http://keirsey.com/personality/ntip.html</a>
types. I make sense of the world by building taxonomies and cause-and-effect
structures to see how well observed reality fits within that model, then
smashing that model and rebuilding it to try to get a better fit with reality.
Life is a quest for a better model of the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
attitude makes the temptation to try to construct some set of foundational
principles for &quot;how magic works&quot; almost irresistible. It's even worse
when I play a game or read a book in which no thought appears to have been
given to how magic works, in which the creator just threw something together
that seems to get the job done. That drives me nuts. Where's the logical
consistency? Where's the coherence of effects? Where's the <i>system</i> that
allows for controlled experimentation? (I said I was one of those crazy
Architect types. ;-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I
naturally think of magic as a system, with rules governed by physical reality
of some kind that can be described and understood. And then I want to explore
those rules to see where the interesting exceptions live. That's what science
does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But on
the other hand, something in me rebels at exposing beauty to harsh lighting and
a microscope. Why can't art simply <i>be</i>? Isn't something of value lost
when you analyze a thing down to its component molecules?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In his
stories, Lord Dunsany liked to refer to the world &quot;beyond the fields we
know.&quot; Tolkien was going after something similar in his concept of
&quot;Faerie.&quot; These artists and others have shared a concern that once
something becomes familiar, it loses its power to inspire. Without an
incomprehensible and inexplicable Other beyond our power to understand, without
a bend in the road beyond which anything could exist, without the possibility
of joy and hope despite pain and loss, the world becomes a gray and dusty
ant-hill of soulless mortals scurrying this way and that to no purpose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For an
artist, that's an unacceptably bitter thought. Existence in a world without
beauty is unendurable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
think of myself as an artist, but I respect that part of the artistic
temperament that tries to ennoble human nature. Like the artist, I also want to
think of magic as tapping into the power of a world of brightness that can't
even be perceived by the gray bureaucrats of our world. Maybe it's possible to
learn how to control this otherworldly power; maybe such power can only be
requested in an extreme circumstance and is never certain. But what it can't be
is understood, because it simply <i>is</i>. To understand it would be to crush
the very thing that gives it its power. You may use it, but you may never
possess it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I find
this concept of magic strongly appealing as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I'm stuck.
I love the idea of building systems of magic, but I know that to do so risks
squeezing the glamour completely out of magic. You probably have to build a
system if you're designing a game that allows player characters to do magic...
but when you do, it's no longer about beauty, it's about numbers, and a spark
of something larger than ourselves is lost in the pursuit of cold game
mechanics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm still
trying to resolve this dilemma, and I'm curious to hear what others think about
it. Does the tension between art and science matter in general? Can it ever be
resolved in a computer game?</span></p>
