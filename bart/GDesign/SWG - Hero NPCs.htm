<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2004/04/09</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>How can
Hero NPCs best be used in a game where all the players want to be heroes, too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
one hand, you've got individual players who in many cases want to be Luke
Skywalker -- they want to do things in the Star Wars universe that <i>matter</i>.
They want to play a meaningful role in an epic story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
other hand... you've got many other individual players who all want to be Luke
Skywalker, too! How in the world do you create a multiplayer game that
satisfies all these people? They can't all be heroes of the Rebellion or the
Empire!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>...or can
they?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To be
successful over the long haul, SWG has to be constructed to give the individual
player just enough freedom to have some impact in the game world, but not
enough to prevent other players from having similar impact based on their own
actions. To achieve this goal requires thinking like an individual player to
understand what they want... but that's not enough. For a player to feel his
actions have meaning -- that he's not just grinding -- the local effects of a
player's actions have to have some cumulative global effect that the player can
see. And that requires a different kind of design thought process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
bottom-up individualistic viewpoint is important, and it's enough to satisfy
the adrenaline junkies over the short term. But for a satisfying long-term
gameplay experience, someone has to have spent some time integrating the
individual game features from a top-down strategic viewpoint. The parts have to
fit together to create a unique and unpredictable (but acceptable) whole. To
put it another way, it's necessary for local effects to accumulate to some
important global result, because that result filtering back down to the
individual player is what proves to him that his actions have meaning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
obvious and subtle ways to accomplish this, but they all hinge on some designer
having thought about how individual actions add up, and on some developer
actually implementing features to sum up actions and reflect the resultant back
to individual players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's
assume for the sake of this discussion that we have or can easily get the first
part of this equation -- that what you and everyone else does is being watched
and remembered and adds up to something that affects the course of the Galactic
Civil War. OK, what then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'll
offer two examples to give you the flavor of what is possible, and what we
might aspire to having in SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. The
Empire</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You are a
faithful servant of the Empire. You've mastered one or two combat professions,
and exterminated countless Rebel scum in your progress through the ranks. In
fact, you just earned enough faction points to buy the rank of Captain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When
other players you know have earned this rank, they've received the usual
message. But something different happens this time -- you get a
&quot;loading&quot; screen. Suddenly you find yourself in a shadowed
(instanced) audience chamber... and you hear the labored panting of someone
using a breathing regulator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Congratulations,
Captain,&quot; you hear Lord Vader say from somewhere in the gloom. &quot;I
have been watching your progress with interest. Your rise through the ranks has
been swift, and the Emperor appreciates your efforts on his behalf.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Without
warning, Darth Vader looms out of the darkness before you. You sense a malign
strength that could crush the life from you with a thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;But
do not think, Captain, that your promotion entitles you to a life of ease. From
those to whom the Emperor has granted authority, much is expected. You must do
more to crush the Rebellion to prove your worthiness to wear this
insignia.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
system dings, and you see a spatial message, &quot;You have been awarded the
Order of the Scarlet Robe, Second Class badge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As Vader
fades back into the shadows, he says, &quot;Do not fail me, Captain. I will be
watching....&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>After
another loading screen, you find yourself back where you were before your
audience with Darth Vader... only now you're sporting a set of captain's bars
and a shiny new badge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Do you
think this would help you feel like a valued soldier of the Empire, and
motivate you to look for more ways to serve the Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. The
Rebellion</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You're a
humble crafter who sympathizes with the Rebellion, but while you've signed up
with a Rebel recruiter you just can't bring yourself to support the Rebellion
overtly. After all, you've got a business to run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But as
time goes by, you notice that the buildings around your shop start to have
Imperial symbols on them. And there seem to be a lot more stormtroopers
hassling you. And your business has fallen off; you're not making as many sales
as you used to, even though your products have improved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One day
you're contentedly tinkering away on a vehicle when the front door of your shop
opens. In walks a customer who exudes an attitude of competence and authority,
and he strides directly up to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;We
need to talk,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm Wedge Antilles, in charge of the
resistance in this area. I know you support us; I've talked to our recruiter...
but what I don't understand is why you're helping the Empire!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>He
gestures forcefully, obviously upset. &quot;Our Bothan spies -- don't bother looking
around, you'll never spot them -- tell us that you're selling a lot of
equipment to Imperials. In fact, you've done so well for them that we're
actually losing the war in this area.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Wedge
glares at you. &quot;We can't afford to have an Imperial sympathizer in our
ranks. So I'm going to make it easy for you: you have a choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;One,&quot;
he says. &quot;You can close up your shop here and move somewhere else where
you can make your equipment for our cause. Or two... you can lose your status
as one of us. If you're going to help the Empire, we don't need you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Wedge
adjusts his jacket as he prepares to leave. &quot;I'll give you a week to
decide. If your shop is still here by then, you'll return to being neutral in
this conflict.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>He looks
you in the eye one last time. &quot;We need you. You're a capable crafter, and
I believe you understand what we're fighting for. I hope you'll do the right
thing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And he
turns and walks out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Do you
think this would give you a greater sense of your value in the game as a whole,
and possibly even persuade you to take a more active role in the GCW?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<hr>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Obvious
and subtle. Subtle in that small actions add up to meaningful results that are
reflected in the game environment, and obvious in that the sum of a player's
actions are occasionally reflected back to that player in a memorable way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A game
like that -- where today's actions have consequences tomorrow -- could last a
long time.</span></p>
