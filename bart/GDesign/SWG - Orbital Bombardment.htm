 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What if
     a city doesn't have a hangar/guns/shield? Should there be a cap on orbital

font-family:Verdana'>What if a player city does not wish to take part in the
GCW? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The more
I think about it, the more it appears that orbital bombardment can only be
factional combat. It's basically long-range, indirect fire PvP.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So it
looks like the concept of a city's &quot;opting in&quot; is required for the
idea of orbital bombardment and city defenses to work, since otherwise you'd be
subjecting people's stuff (their structures) to PvP without their necessarily
having declared a faction. The question is how you allow cities to opt in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One way
would be simple: key it off of having a city shield generator. If you plant
one, then that's your city's declaration that it's factional. And if you have
two styles of city shield generator -- one Rebel, one Imperial -- then that
determines your city's faction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
(and probably better) way to let a city declare that it is a factional city
would be to allow Mayors to put it to a vote -- if the referendum passes, then
your city (whether you voted that way or not) goes to whichever faction was
stated in the proposed &quot;law.&quot; This way you could change your city's
faction without having to rebuild/redeed a city shield generator of the
&quot;correct&quot; type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>What if I am in a player city (just passing through, for
example) that gets bombed by neutron bombs, although I don't want to
participate in PvP? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the fundamental rules of SWG has been that you should never be <i>forced</i> to
particpate in PvP. In practice this has been interpreted to mean that no player
can injure another player through combat actions unless both players have
explicitly and deliberately signed on with either the Imperial or Rebel
factions (either covertly or overtly). It doesn't matter how weird it looks; if
you're neutral, no other player can touch you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Therefore
it's reasonable to expect that this rule would apply to orbital bombardment as
well. If orbital bombardment is a factional attack -- and I can't see how it
could not be -- then if you're neutral and strolling through a city that's in
the process of being bombed back to the Stone Age, you can lie down in the
street and enjoy the light show, because not a blessed thing will happen to
you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
other hand, if you do happen to be factional, then no matter what faction you
are you should take some damage from orbital bombardment striking a city where
you happen to be walking. That would be part of the risk of choosing to be a
soldier in the GCW.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where it
gets tricky is when we're talking about a neutral player with structures (a
house, harvesters, factories) in a factional player city. Should that player's
belongings be subject to damage from orbital bombardment?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I would
say yes. This would depend on it having been made clear to each citizen that he
or she was living/building in a city that had declared one way or the other in
the GCW. This could be done through email, and possibly through posted signs
and/or system messages -- &quot;Attention! You are now entering an Imperial
municipality!&quot; Players who did not wish to be subject to orbital
bombardment would have to move out of town, but maybe that's part of what a
city thinks about when it decides whether or not it wants to declare a faction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here's
another related issue: Suppose you're away from SWG for a week. You've paid up
your maintenance for a couple of weeks, but suppose that as soon as you were
gone your city got hit several times from space and your house lost all its
maintenance. In a few days it would drop to 0% condition -- so what happens to
your stuff?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Situations
like this make me think there'd have to be some kinds of caps on how much
damage orbital bombardment could do. It should be enough to cause some pain,
but not enough to do irrevocable damage (like losing all your stuff).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is there
a better way to go than to score bombardment damage as maintenance or condition
points?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>some players might feel that this is just a scheme to get
(or force) them to buy JtL. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Possibly.
Others might see it as a way to allow player cities participate in JtL in an
interesting and useful way. So I suspect this one is a wash, but it's still
helpful to remind us that sometimes perceptions matter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Other than that, seems like a cool idea. Maybe it could
apply to bases, but not cities? Or cities that have bases associated with them?
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I like
it. The idea of letting a city declare itself as factional by associating that
city with a factional base seems like another reasonable way to signal a city's
willingness to participate in the GCW.</span></p>
