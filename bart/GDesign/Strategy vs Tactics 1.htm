<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Given how
popular combat is in MMORPGs, there’s a lot of discussion about how to
implement it. As I read many discussions of what people want, I'm noticing a
lot of players – and even some developers -- using the terms
&quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;tactics&quot; interchangeably, as if they're the
same thing. But they aren't -- they're two very different concepts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
that the combat team leader who knows and appreciates the differences between
strategy and tactics is going to outperform the one who doesn't. With that in
mind, I offer the following notes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(I should
point out here that while I’ve studied this stuff pretty intensively as a
historian and student of game design, I never served in any branch of any
military. If that kills the value for you of anything I might say on the
subject, feel free to skip to something else that looks more interesting.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Modern
military doctrine generally recognizes four levels of control in military
action:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Tactics</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Operations</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Strategy</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Grand
     Strategy</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Tactics
are the hands-on, environmentally determined actions taken to win battles. To
put it another way: tactics are <i>techniques</i>. Examples of tactical action
include: how to set and spring an ambush; how to detect an ambush; how to move quietly
through hostile territory; how to probe enemy positions to gain intel; how to
dig a fighting position; how to properly place observation, listening and
command posts; how to place mines for maximum effectiveness; how to capture a
bridge intact; how to rig charges to blow a bridge; how to cross a river
without a bridge; how to place, set up, fortify, and guard an encampment; and
so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note that
all of the examples given start with the word &quot;how&quot; -- that's not
accidental. Tactics are all about &quot;how,&quot; as opposed to
&quot;what&quot; or &quot;where&quot; or &quot;why,&quot; which are properly
determined by the next military levels up. Every MMORPG I know of is almost
exclusively concerned with tactics. So the first thing the good squad leader does
when a new MMORPG comes out is explore -- go find out what the environment is
like in lots of places, and play around to try to identify ways in which
players can interact with each other and with the environment. That's how you
learn what the physical rules are that govern the environment. This battlespace
intelligence will cue the smart squad leader to the tactics that will make him
successful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
Operations level is the level concerned with specifying battlefield objectives
-- the &quot;what,&quot; as in &quot;what bridge should we take?&quot;
&quot;what hills, if we take them, could block the enemy's resupply lines in
this area?&quot; &quot;what training do we need to be prepared to carry out our
mission?&quot; Operations is the &quot;middle-management&quot; of the military,
translating the strategic goals enunciated by general staff officers into plans
for action, and passing intel (friendly and enemy) back up the chain of command
for decision-making. Ops bosses look at enemy positions and strengths in their
area, and at the assets and capabilities of the units under their command, then
based on these myriad factors devise operational plans for pitting strength
against weakness to be able to advance constantly from victory to victory. In
most MMORPGs, the only operations-level activity comes from raid leaders who
keep their units together over multiple missions, and who thus keep track of
player attributes and skills, types of weapons and amounts of ammunition, and
who possibly coordinate with other raid leaders to achieve victory across an
entire battlefield.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Then, and
only then, comes &quot;strategy.&quot; If tactics are how you win a battle,
strategy is how you win a war. Successful strategic-level thinking is concerned
with the logistical movement of entire armies and materiel to achieve total
military dominance. If you've read Sun Tzu's <i>The Art of War</i>, you know
that this general was not nearly so concerned with how to win any particular
battle as he was with demonstrating such force of arms as to win entire wars
(even before they begin if possible). Strategy, as Sun Tzu articulated, is the formulation
of specific but broad-scale and long-lasting military goals. When General
Norman Schwarzkopf was given his orders (from the &quot;grand strategy&quot;
level of commander-in-chief and joint staffs chairman) to &quot;liberate
Kuwait,&quot; he didn't think about tactics or operations: he looked at the
national maps; he looked at the intel on enemy strengths and locations; he
looked at the troops and materiel gathered during Desert Shield; he listened to
the ideas of his Central Command staff officers; and then he thought. The
strategy he devised is what we now call the &quot;Hail Mary Strategy&quot; that
moved entire coalition armies around to the west and then north of Basra to cut
off the line of retreat for the Iraqi army in Kuwait, while feinting to
distract enemy attention with a fake landing of Marines to the east of Kuwait
City. This wasn't a tactic for winning a battle, or a plan for controlling an
area, nor was it even a strategy for hammering a foe into dust. It was a
strategy right out of Sun Tzu for demoralizing an entire enemy army to the
point that it surrendered <i>en masse</i> -- which is exactly what happened. In
Star Wars terms, Grand Moff Tarkin was acting strategically when he used the
major power at his command (the Death Star) to destroy Alderaan. This wasn't to
win any battle; it was to shatter the will of the Rebellion to fight, and thus
to win the entire war. That's strategy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
the highest level of military control is the &quot;grand strategy&quot; level,
where military force is combined with political force to achieve a
restructuring of power among nations or even civilizations, creating balance of
power effects which may last for centuries. The grand strategy of Rome two millenia ago was to expand by the dual use of military force to conquer new
territories and peoples, and the political inducement of offering Roman
citizenship to conquered peoples to eliminate rebellion before it even started.
We today see mostly the fall of Rome after it declined into Empire, but their
grand strategy served them very effectively for hundreds of years. Similarly,
the grand strategy in Star Wars is devised and ordered by the Emperor
Palpatine. It was Palpatine who encouraged the predations of the Trade
Federation that led to his selection as Chancellor; it was Palpatine who directed
Count Dooku to lead hundreds of star systems to secede from the Republic, thus
permitting Palpatine to create the clone army that would serve him as he
converted the Republic into an Empire. Pitting Senator against Senator, and
clone army against battledroids, Palpatine skillfully executed a grand strategy
of combined political manipulation and military force that allowed him to
become the all-powerful Emperor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Until the
grand strategy of the light side of the Force proved stronger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Personally,
I'd be pleasantly astonished if there were any in-game mechanics to support
operations-level activity. As far as being able (as a player) to make
strategic-level decisions goes... well, they'd probably find me days later, an
emaciated wreck, my hands still on the keyboard and a grin on my face. :)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Until
then, it will reduce confusion to bear in mind that virtually all combat
activity is current MMORPGs is <i>tactical</i>, not strategic.</span></p>
