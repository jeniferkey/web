<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Hard caps
on the number of skills or skill levels a character can posses do a couple of
useful things in MMOGs. One is to simulate the difficulty people have in
learning new skills. The other is to increase uniqueness among characters by
limiting the skills that can be learned to a subset of all possible skills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Are those
benefits valuable enough to use a hard cap system? Are there other ways of
getting these benefits (assuming you agree that they're benefits) than hard
caps?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, take that first benefit of simulating the difficulty of increasing
one's abilities. Instead of a hard cap, you could use an economic approach that
makes later skills cost more than skills taken earlier in a character's life.
Rather than being an arbitrary number, this would actually be a more accurate
way to simulate limits to learning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
a couple of obvious ways to do this. One is to rank skills by power and make
the more powerful skills cost more to obtain. (A lot of MMOGs use some form of
this approach.) Another would be to treat all skills (and all levels of skills
if you have skill levels) as equally difficult, but calculate the learning cost
of each new skill based on the number of skills you already have -- the more
skills you have, the harder it is to learn a new skill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As for
limiting skills -- usually through a class system -- I believe that casual
players are better off with an unlimited skills system than they are with a
class-specific skills system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As
evidence, I offer EVE Online. EVE has an effectively unlimited skill system. (I
say &quot;effectively&quot; because while there's a limited number of skills,
the amount of time required to learn all the highest levels of all the existing
skills is so great that it would take years to do so, by which time the
developers will have added new skills to learn.) But EVE is still playable by
casual players because skills are learned over time, rather than by collecting
and cashing in skill points.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Consider
the skill Connections (which improves your standing with NPC agents, opening up
more quests that you can take). No matter who your character is or what other
skills your character knows, no matter when you started playing EVE Online or
how many hours a day you play, your character is going to require at least two
real-time weeks to learn the fifth and highest level of the Connections skill.
Your character learns at the same rate regardless of whether you the player are
online in the game or offline, so every player enjoys an absolutely level
playing field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
there's no level grind in EVE Online, and thus over time no significant
disparity between veteran and casual players. It's a thing of beauty. And
there's no reason at all why other games can't figure out some equally creative
alternative to mindless grinding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why
impose hard caps on skills when there are other (and better) ways to regulate
the growth of character power?</span></p>
