Ideas for MMORPGs</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/04/11,
revised 2006/05/10</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Looking
at the MMOGs that have been tried to date, and considering the announced
features of the numerous MMOGs currently under development, there appear to be certain
assumptions being made by a lot of them. When these assumptions are questioned,
they're usually defended with comments like, &quot;But we're just giving
players what they say they want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe
it's just me, but when I see that, what I actually hear is &quot;WoW is
grossing $80 million a month.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well,
that's nice, but Blizzard/Vivendi have already locked up the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-mover_advantage">second-mover
advantage</a> with WoW. If it's that popular, why would anyone leave it to play
a game designed to be just like it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'd
rather see some well-funded designers deliberately question the conventional
wisdom. Why be satisfied with a fragment of the WoW market when you have a
chance to define a new market for yourself?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If that
makes any sense, then the next step is to identify the most common design
assumptions. Some of them might need to be retained because they still offer
value, while others can be flipped, but you can't make such analytical
decisions without actually trying to identify a list of such assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So here
are what I see as some of the most common assumptions currently being made by
online game designers (feel free to suggest others):</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>online
     games must be massively multiplayer</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>design
     focus on play mechanics instead of on play styles</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>gameplay
     emphasized over depth and breadth of world</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>fantasy
     genre</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>hyperfocus
     on competitive gameplay (usually one-on-one combat)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>characters
     must &quot;grow&quot;</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>characters
     cannot die (permadeath can be avoided or isn't even possible)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>characters
     must choose a class/profession</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>characters
     grow through increasing levels within a class</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>levels
     are gained by repeatedly performing simple actions (&quot;grinding&quot;)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>classes
     defined by AD&amp;D-inspired combat roles (warrior, mage, healer, rogue)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>gameplay
     designed around supporting those combat roles</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>grouping
     is required to access high-level &quot;end game&quot; content</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>non-player
     combatants drop loot when killed</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>value
     of loot drops keyed to non-player combatant level</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>NPCs don't
     need to be more than standalone loot bags or quest dispensers</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>gameplay
     takes place on a few relatively small, static land areas</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>areas
     are divided into even smaller &quot;zones&quot;</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
have been MMOGs that challenge one or two of these assumptions. Pre-NGE Star
Wars Galaxies allowed you to spend 250 skill points on individual abilities
within some 30+ professions (instead of limiting you to one class out of just a
few). Dark Age of Camelot allowed more focus on &quot;realm vs. realm&quot;
combat than simple one-on-one PvP dueling. A Tale in the Desert emphasizes
crafting and commerce over combat. Hero's Journey will allow dual-classing. And
WoW lets you solo your way to level 60 (but turns very group-oriented at that
point). In most other ways, however, these MMOGs follow many of the
conventional assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>EVE
Online is often cited as particularly innovative because it challenges several
of the standard assumptions: it's not a fantasy world; characters progress by
learning skills, not by picking a class and increasing one's level in that
class; skills are learned in real time, not advanced by grinding; commerce is
relatively well-developed; and with some 5000 star systems, the playing field
is somewhat larger than in most MMOGs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But while
I applaud these design decisions, even EVE embraces some of the most common
assumptions: it's intensely competitive (full-time PvP everywhere, and even
commerce is cutthroat); only a few hundred star systems can actually be
accessed by most players; star systems are relatively small zones; characters
must grow by learning new skills to be able to compete with other players; and
while solo play is possible, it's not rewarded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where's
the designer who's willing to really bust out of these chains?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>OK -- if this
list adequately identifies some of the most common assumptions, what should we
do about them? Here are some suggestions for how to rectify some (but,
thankfully, not all!) of those assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Basic
Gameplay:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'd like
to see gameplay designed to satisfy the different personality styles of gamers,
rather than just rushing to implement the favorite gameplay mechanics of the
designer. Instead of yet another game aimed at one particular personality type,
we need games that respect and welcome all kinds of players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Richard
Bartle's four player types -- Killers, Achievers, Explorers, and Socializers
(from his &quot;<a href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">Players Who
Suit MUDs</a>&quot; essay) -- would be a great place to start in designing a
truly inclusive game. Or you could craft your gameplay around David Keirsey's
four temperaments -- Artisans, Guardians, Rationals, and Idealists (which I
believe are the larger-scale version of Bartle's player types). Or you could
use the Myers-Briggs model, or the Big Five model, or Dr. John M. Oldham's
fourteen styles derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual used by
psychiatrists, or some other model of personality. But it's time for games to
be designed based on the real-world differences between people (which
eliminates scientifically bogus &quot;models&quot; of personality such as
astrology, enneagrams, and blood type) instead of targeting only one type of
gamer. Why ignore other potential paying customers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One goal
of designing for playstyle must be to achieve an equal balance between
competitive and cooperative gameplay. Currently &quot;cooperative&quot; means
&quot;group combat,&quot; but that's only cooperation to achieve a competitive
end. Cooperative play is worthwhile in and of itself, and game designers ought
to create features that reward it accordingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
concrete suggestion for how to accomplish this, I advocate designing features
that are balanced equally between combat, commerce, exploration, and social
gameplay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By all means,
design a great combat game... but be determined to create an equally great
commercial game, and consciously design both of these systems to please gamers
who enjoy full-tilt-boogie competition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>At the
same time, cooperation as found in exploratory and social gameplay should also
be rewarded in equal measure. Let the explorers enjoy discovering new places,
as well as the hidden rules that govern how the game world works. (But don't
offer accumulatable rewards for doing so, or you'll just turn exploration into
another Achiever system.) And take the time to welcome social gamers with lots
of story-driven content that lets them imagine themselves to be the people
they'd like to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Build
great gameplay for competitive people who want to &quot;play in&quot; online
games. And build richly detailed worlds for cooperative people who want to
&quot;live in&quot; online games. And let your gameplay and world designs build
on one another to the advantage of both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
every system in the game should be consciously designed to support one or more
of the four major gameplay modes. And all four modes should be consciously
designed as mutually supporting pillars of the entire game, working together to
form a single coherent structure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
that's how you wind up with a product that's both distinctly memorable and
commercially successful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Gameplay
Specifics:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>hybrid
     ability system</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Stop
forcing everyone into a rigid class system. Instead, key in-game abilities to
both individual skills and skill groups (careers/professions/classes), and
allow players to decide which approach is right for their character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Any
skills can be chosen, and any career track (or none) can be chosen, but it's OK
if some skills are more useful in certain careers. Let players choose the
skills they want, then let the skills they've picked define their careers... or
not. If I enjoy playing a cowboy whose skills are all taken from the
&quot;diplomacy&quot; column, why force me to take cowboy skills or shove me
into a Diplomat class?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Concerning
minmaxing, you're never going to get away from that entirely. Achievers and
some the Explorers will always go for optimal efficiency. But you don't
minimize this by abstracting abilities into rigid classes -- that just
concentrates the problem. Instead, the goal should be to make sure every
ability has both an advantage and a cost. If abilities only have advantages,
many players will load up on the &quot;most&quot; advantageous abilities. But
if abilities also carry costs, then because different players will count costs
differently, they'll choose different abilities. As long as abilities are
balanced for power -- and combinations of abilities are carefully tested! --
there should be less tendency to cluster around a few skills.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>no
     character levels</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Stop
thinking that characters have to &quot;grow.&quot; When I've asked people why
they say they like character growth as a feature, most have replied with
something like, &quot;Because gamers expect it.&quot; But that's not an answer;
that's a rationalization, and it deserves to be challenged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Give
players lots of options when creating characters... and then let them play
those characters. You should be fully ready to play as soon as you're done
creating a character. With complete characters, there's no need to spend days
or weeks or months grinding to get to the high-end content -- it's all high-end
content. Some of it might be harder than others, but that's an opportunity to
reward ingenuity and promote cooperative play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(An
alternative approach might be to offer more character levels to those players
who care most about public markers of accomplishment -- the Achievers -- and
fewer or no levels to players who are less concerned with &quot;being the
best&quot; or &quot;having the most&quot;. The Achievers will still wind up
with grinding, but at least your other players won't be wedged into that
gameplay as well.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Player
characters are hard to kill, but if your character dies you just create a new
character and jump right back into the action. (Allowing possessions to be
&quot;willed&quot; to the next incarnation is an obvious response to the
objection that uber loot would take the place of levels in a no-advancement
game.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>

     power carries more responsibility</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If making
a character more powerful is an end unto itself, your competitive game will
always devolve into a sad, Hobbesian, looking-out-for-number-one ProgressQuest
(<a href="http://www.progressquest.com/">http://www.progressquest.com/</a>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Power
should never come for free. Tactical-level players should be responsible only
for themselves and their own pleasure, but the price of this should be having
to take orders from other players. Strategic-level players should give orders
and be rewarded according to how fun they make the game for other players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>

     through careers not mandatory</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Players
should be free to choose whether they want to advance to higher levels of power
and responsibility. If you enjoy strategic gameplay, you should be able to do
the things that are necessary to advance to that role. But if you prefer
tactical gameplay, you shouldn't be penalized for wanting to continue playing
in that role. A reward that forces you to change the kind of game you enjoy
playing isn't a reward at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>mix of
     solo careers and grouping careers</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
careers, such as combat, reward grouping and offer specific roles. Other
careers, such as prospecting or scouting, reward independent play and place
less emphasis (or none at all) on career advancement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Equating
&quot;rewards&quot; with &quot;loot&quot; turns a game into an
Achiever-specific game. Achievers care about accumulating things, so some
amount of loot is worth offering. But it can't be allowed to take over the game
or you'll drive away other kinds of players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you
really want to attract other kinds of players, you'll expend some effort to
think about what those other players want and how to give it to them for doing
what they enjoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Combat is
a major feature of most MMOGs, and for that reason alone it can't be ignored. It
can also be fun for almost any kind of player, if implemented well. Combat is a
reasonable thing to have in a MMOG, and it should be included and done well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But it
shouldn't take over! Making an entire game revolve around how fast and how
often players can kill every living thing in sight sharply limits that game's
value -- I believe there are a lot of potential gamers who are turned off by
the way so many MMOGs exclusively reward constant destruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Give
combat its place in the game. But give commerce and exploration and
socialization their places as well, and don't turn those gameplay modes into
mere support classes for combat. Balanced gameplay is more fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>content</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>No single
developer will ever win the content race. Because a game will have vastly more
players than developers (you hope!), players will always consume content faster
than you can provide it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So trying
to crank out enough content by yourself is a losing proposition. Instead,
consider some or all of the following ways to provide content:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>handcrafted
      (most MMOGs)</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>player
      scripted (Second Life -- <a href="http://secondlife.com/">http://secondlife.com/</a>)</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>procedural
      (Spore -- <a href="http://www.spore.com/">http://www.spore.com/</a>,
      Infinity -- <a href="http://www.fl-tw.com/Infinity/">http://www.fl-tw.com/Infinity/</a>)</span></li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Each of
these approaches has plusses and minuses, but a game that uses all of them to
best advantage will be able to earn a reputation as always having the freshest
content... and in a consumer world that values constant novelty, that's a big
deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>massively
     single-player?</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
and most way-out of all, why do we assume that massively multiplayer game
worlds have to have other people in them all the time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Spore
(now pushed back to April of 2007, unfortunately) is said to be not so much
massively multi-player as &quot;massively single-player.&quot; Interaction with
other players will exist, but it will be much less direct than in traditional
MMOGs. Your game universe still be in contact with others, but you won't be
seeing avatars of other gamers inside your game world while you're playing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
got both good and bad consequences. For players who really like interacting
(constructively or destructively) with other human beings, something useful is
lost when other people aren't in the game. On the other hand, players who are
less social or who hate having to put up with griefers can limit and control
their interactions. On the gripping hand, other players are what make virtual worlds
dynamic; without them changing and defining the character of the game world,
it's really hard to make the world feel alive. Oblivion has done so to some
degree, but only to the point of entering the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; where
behavior seems bizarre because it's almost-but-not-quite-plausible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe
it's time for an online game to push on this assumption and see what gives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Obviously
not all of these suggestions will be palatable to everyone. I believe that if you
designed a game that implemented many of them together, the resulting mixture
would be not only distinctive in a field full of WoW-clones, but highly
satisfying to a lot of gamers. (Read: financially successful.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
reasonably well-heeled developer needs to take up the challenge of questioning
these assumptions and do something different. It doesn't have to be radically
different (although that would be interesting). It just needs to be different
enough to prove that trying to copy WoW isn't the only path to commercial and
artistic success. A healthy MMOG industry needs someone to take a few risks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Or am I
wrong, and making another conventional class-based fantasy combat game is good
enough?</span></p>
