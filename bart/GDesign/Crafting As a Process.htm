As a Process</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2006/06/27</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I've sort of started to
wonder whether a lot of developers have a funny idea of what
&quot;crafting&quot; is... or maybe I'm the one with the funny idea. Either
way, there's a gap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I can understand designers
thinking of crafting as being about servicing the game economy. In other words,
designers design a crafting system as an economic support system -- its purpose
is to insure that other players can have the stuff they need/want to play the
game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Well, yes, that's a useful
function of a crafting system... but what does that offer the people who like
to make things?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>My problem with crafting
systems in nearly all current and discussed MMORPGs is that they're not focused
on satisfying the people who craft because they actually enjoy crafting.
&quot;Crafters&quot; aren't all automatons who thrill to the opportunity to
grind out gazillions of copies of some uber weapon, nor are they all
hypercompetitive economic PvPers who see crafting as a sales game -- they are
creative people who enjoy imagining new things and bringing them into the
(game) world. It's the enjoyment of making new things in and of itself that
appeals to the crafter personality, not the utility of the end product.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Accordingly, my one great
interest in any MMORPG's crafting system is that it be more about process than
product.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Don't worry about whether
crafters will crank out enough units of Product X to satisfy demand. Make the
process of crafting so much fun in and of itself that lots of people want to do
it and (assuming you also implement a free-market player economy) the results
will take care of themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>So how can this be
accomplished? I believe the three keys to enabling a fun crafting process are:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>1. Great variation in
resource and configuration inputs is possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2. The attributes of
outputs mirror the attributes of their inputs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>3. Players can choose to
trade quality for quantity in outputs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>In a little more detail:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>1. By variation of inputs
I mean two things. First, there should be a vast number of resources/components
needed to make things, and all those resources and components should have
multiple attributes of varying degrees. And second, there should be a
appropriate number of ways to connect each of those resources and components to
each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Variation of inputs allows
players to experiment with inputs to see what works best for a given purpose.
It supports treating crafting as an exploratory process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2. Allowing outputs to
derive their attributes from their inputs gives structure to crafting
exploration. If through crafting some test items I can learn that using a
certain kind of wood or a resource with a high level of copper turns my
finished product green, that's information I can use later if I ever want to
make something that's green.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Similarly, letting
crafters experiment with how resources and components are connected to each
other (in more complex crafting procedures) should also have some plausible
effect on the final product. Perhaps connecting a flywheel to an engine through
a gear will make the complete device more efficient, though perhaps also
resulting in a higher maintenance cost due to more parts....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>3. Letting players decide
whether to optimize an individual crafting process for quality or quantity is a
way to support both creative crafters as well as those current players who
regard crafting as a competitive economic game. If you want to try to corner
the market on widgets, OK, but optimizing your crafting process for quantity
will mean that you can't make the &quot;best&quot; widget possible. Likewise,
if you want to try to make the most perfect widget possible, you're only going
to be able to make a very small number of them, and the cost in failed
experiments will probably be pretty high.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<hr>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>A crafting system designed
to incorporate these principles for focusing on process would, I think, be one
that satisfies everyone's needs. The artistic crafter can create; the
exploratory crafter can tinker; the sales crafter can meet market demands; and
the developers can all buy Ferraris with the revenue from the subscriptions
from happy gamers. :-)</span></p>
