<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>We are committed to releasing new dungeons in between each
publish. We want these to be of the highest quality. The Geo Lab is a good
example of what we are shooting for. The Corvette is next, and it is awesome.
I'll go into more detail about what else is on the horizon later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where is
it written that &quot;content&quot; == &quot;dungeons&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
recognize that a majority of SWG players are primarily (if not exclusively)
interested in combat, and that development needs to focus on adding content
that will keep these folks playing SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But it's
my impression that SWG was never meant to be purely a fighting game. Crafters,
explorers, merchants, and even entertainers were all to have useful roles to
play. Maybe these roles were simply to support the fighters, but as I
understood it the ultimate goal was a game that would allow players the
flexibility to have fun in the ways they most enjoyed while supporting the
combat-oriented community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So why is
it that when &quot;content&quot; is discussed it seems always to be
combat-specific? I don't mind seeing new dungeons, and combat redesigns, and
revamped battlefields, and the many tweaks and fixes to existing combat
rules... but where are the busy new crafthalls for the folks making the weapons
and armor? Where are the new stages for dancers and musicians? Where are the
strange new worlds for Scouts and Rangers to explore? Where are the new Player
Contracts for Merchants (as proposed in my message # 4421 in Core Systems)? In
short, where's the content for non-combat players that's as cool as the new
dungeons for combat players?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One bit
of good news here is the Droid Invasion. I applaud the attention now being
given to this aspect of SWG gameplay. My hope is that along with the new
features the droid constructors will also gain new <i>content</i> that allows
them to use those new features. In other words, the new features will be nice
but not exciting if all that Droid Engineers can do with them is build more new
droids -- they need opportunities to feel that using their new skills matter
within the game, just as combat players get to apply their skills in the new
dungeons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Again, I
am in no way suggesting that combat players shouldn't be getting new content. I
think it's great that they are; I support that. What I'm suggesting is that
some additional attention be given to creating similarly engaging content for
non-combat players. These folks matter to SWG, too -- if too many of them walk
because they're bored, where will fighters get their weapons and armor? Who'll
buff them? Who'll heal their battle fatigue?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The new
content for fighters is great. Now it would be helpful to see that similarly
exciting content is planned for the rest of the folks who support SWG.</span></p>
