<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MaxKempis,
I pretty much concur with all your points. In fact, I've made them myself
several times over the past two years I've been jabbering on the SWG forums --
my thread <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=lightspeed&amp;message.id=28832">Implementing
Space Commerce: A Design Proposal</a> in this forum is just one example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Bottom
line, JtL ought to have some gameplay features to support player commerce in
its initial release. But since that's not going to happen, we players should
work with the developers to try to identify what space commerce features would
be most desirable to have in a future enhancement of JtL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Obligatory
disclaimer: I don't mind at all that combat is well-developed in JtL -- in
fact, I'd have disagreed if it hadn't gotten a lot of developer attention.
Space combat is an important part of Star Wars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But it's
not the only important thing that happens in Star Wars! Combat should have
gotten the bulk of developer attention, but not <i>all</i> the attention, not
even in the initial release. Yes, people fight in the Star Wars movies and
books... but that is most certainly not all they do. Watch any of the movies --
any time there's a scene with a town or city, the screen is filled with people
trying to make a few credits.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Combat is
a key part of the Star Wars experience, but commerce is also crucial. That's
why SWG's developers deserve praise for the excellent crafting system they
created for the SWG ground game... and it's why they deserve some criticism for
failing to offer meaningful features supporting commercial gameplay in JtL.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now,
having said that, I'd like to try to distill the points mde by most of us who
want space commerce down to the fundamentals. After giving this a lot of
thought (you might say I've been at it for several years), I think I can
identify three game features that must be supplied by the developers of a MMOG
for player commerce to be interesting and fun enough to succeed:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Freighters can carry more cargo than fighters.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This one
is simple: If fighters can carry lots of cargo, then everyone will fly fighters
and there'll be no way to distinguish the purely commerce-oriented player from
the combat-oriented player. And a valuable part of the commercial experience
(call it a roleplaying issue if you like) will be lost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
Players can readily discover commodity prices in other places.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Also
reasonably simple to understand: If you can't determine which cargos might be
profitable -- if every trip is a completely random, high-stakes gamble -- then
most players just won't ever do commerce. There must be some degree of price
stability that allows players to learn what tends to sell well in particular
places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>How this
is accomplished isn't as important as that it's in the game in some form. You
could do it purely through players leaving &quot;Want Ads&quot; on an
appropriately-enhanced Bazaar terminal. (I call these Shipping Terminals.)
Freighter captains could read these ads and gamble that they'll be the first to
ship the requested item to the player asking for them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
slightly less social but possibly more interesting approach would be to offer
some players (Merchants, most likely) the ability to read reports on Bazaar
statistics over, say, the most recent week. In this way you could see that over
the past week, the best-selling item on Tatooine or in Kor Vella has been
Non-Ferrous Metals with a high SR. With this information, you might decide to speculate
that this would still be valuable. Then you could check to see where this kind
of material is selling in large amounts for the least number of credits. Armed
with this information, you'd be able to buy X number of units of this resource,
then hire a freighter pilot to haul it to a Shipping Terminal at the
appropriate destination. The interesting part of this approach is that it uses
the profit motive to get players to move resources from where they're produced
to where they're most needed (using average purchase price and volume as
indicators of need) -- by helping the economy do better, Merchants could help
themselves as well... and free up freighter captains to do freight runs instead
of being cargo speculators themselves (though they could certainly do both if
they spend their skillpoints accordingly).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3.
Commodity prices must change over time.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When
Freelancer is played as a single-player game, commodity prices don't change
much. If you repeatedly haul Diamonds to New Tokyo, the price won't vary. But
then it shouldn't, given that you're the only player in the game, and that the
game &quot;ends&quot; when you quit playing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a
multiplayer game, commodity prices must change over time. Not only are other
players also affecting the supply and demand of commodities with their
commercial activities, this activity goes on constantly -- possibly over RL
years if the game is successful. If prices don't change somehow, then every
player can identify the most profitable trade routes and just run them over and
over again. Boring!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So prices
have to fluctuate somehow. Depending on how clever the programmers want to be,
they could simulate trade activity by NPCs, semi-randomly creating shortages
and gluts of various things in various places. Or if you have enough real
players, simulating NPC commerce might not be necessary -- the commercial
actions of players might be enough to affect prices in meaningful ways. If the
residents of Moenia are willing to pay a lot for Organics with high OQ and PE,
and a bunch of players start shipping that resource to Moenia, then that should
lead to an excess of supply, which lowers demand, which lowers the average
price, which makes some other commodity wanted somewhere else more valuable,
and freighters change their course to service the new demand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The value
of a fluctuating supply-and-demand price system in a MMOG is that players can't
all get rich doing the same thing over and over, but instead must actively
check the markets (see item #2 above) to make decisions about dynamically-changing
trade routes. What might be lucrative this week could be near-worthless to you
next week (but could be great for a new player), and vice versa. This leads
different players to have different gameplay behaviors, and also leads
individual players to change their gameplay behavior over time... and both of
these consequences are good for a multiplayer game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<hr>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The good
news is that SWG is tantalizingly close to offering all three of these necessary
features. (Close enough that JtL Lead Designer Cinco Barnes thinks that players
will spontaneously choose to engage in commercial behavior in JtL despite the
absence of developer features to validate that kind of gameplay. I disagree,
but I could certainly be wrong.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To a
significant degree, item #3 is already in the game -- resources in SWG spawn
and despawn in different places with different attribute values. This creates a
fluctuating supply-and-demand system for raw resources. (This week the best Fiberplast
is on Lok; next week it might be on Naboo.) It doesn't do much for manufactured
items, however, so that's one area that could be improved, but at least
resources have adaptive pricing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Item #1
is also substantially in JtL, as this expansion offers ships in which items can
be stored. If &quot;freighters&quot; in JtL provided some kind of
cargo-carrying advantage over players using personal inventories to carry items
in starfighters, then that solves #1. But even as it is, #1 is substantially acceptable
in JtL as it's being implemented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
leaves item #2 -- a way to discover prices for specific goods in specific
places. One obvious way is just to fly there... but by the time you get there
to learn that they want X, then fly around to find X at a sufficiently low
price to make a profit, then fly back to where you want to sell it, chances are
good that someone will already have beaten you to it. Enough frustrations like
that and players just won't do this kind of thing. This is where I disagree
with Cinco Barnes -- I think the game needs to provide a specific feature to
help players discover prices. It shouldn't do all their work for them, but
there has to be some game feature that offers players a reasonably good chance
that their risk in buying some commodity and transporting it elsewhere will
turn a profit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Honestly,
I think it's that we're so close to having a full-bodied space commerce system
in JtL that is so frustrating!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe the
players who want this kind of advanced gameplay in SWG will be willing to wait
for it... assuming some other online game that does this kind of thing
brilliantly doesn't come along before then, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

needs to be a level with high risk that comes with a high reward. Random is
good. I played Earth and Beyond for some time, the trade system in that game
got stale very fast...Why? Because the best way to make cash on trade runs was
to run the same route over and over again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>There needs to be a few ways to do it. The easy/low paying

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
basically the point I was trying to make. There has to be enough price
stability in the low-risk/low-paying cargoes for new players to be able to
survive, but there also needs to be enough price randomness to allow for the
high-risk/high-paying cargo runs that can make a player wealthy (and
legendary). The high-risk cargo opportunities should be rare, and they should
fail to pay off more often than not -- the frequency needs to be just high
enough so that every now and then there's a story about some individual player
who got rich, but not high enough to materially affect any galaxy's economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One new
feature that might help accomplish this could be space-based resources --
basically, asteroid mining. If certain resources necessary for building
starships or ship components could only be found in space, and if the spawning
of those resources was properly controlled (through spawn rates, spawn
locations, NPC/creature guardians, etc.), that would allow an extremely dynamic
supply-and-demand system of the type we're discussing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A good
dynamic economic system with prices determined by supply and demand would allow
both the common low-risk/low-paying and the rare high-risk/high-paying cargoes
that could make space commerce a viable gameplay option.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The fact
that this would probably include and improve the ground-based economy as well
is a nice bonus.</span></p>

it's a neat idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
question that comes to mind is whether space would work (in, presumably, a 3-D
mode) like planetary surfaces, which at any point could offer 20 or more
resources in varying percentage availabilities. If space worked the same way,
how would you pick which resource you were getting? If you didn't have some
automatic rule (such as &quot;whatever resource is most prominent&quot;), you'd
have to add a UI to let the player choose which resource to scoop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Balancing is key here: You want the rate at which a
space-based player to harvest goods to be comparable to that of a
Small/Medium/Heavy Harvester. If he's flying through near-empty space, he only
gets a few hundred units an hour, as he's slurping hard vaccuum. If he's
passing right through a star, or bounces too close to a supernova, it could end
his trip real quick, but it grants him the equivalent of being on a 90%+
concentration. If he's after metals, he can grind away on asteroids for a safe
(but slow) resource extraction rate. Or he can take on PC or NPC opponents -- and
get loot worth more than &quot;1 unit of steel&quot; like in the land game. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First,
space shouldn't offer resources at a faster rate than you could get on the
ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Second,
it might be interesting to tie resource harvesting rates in space to the level
of risk you accept to get those resources. On the ground, your harvesting rate
is determined by the size and number of your harvesters... but what if
harvesting in space requires your active presence?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
would allow resource spawning to be controlled more dynamically, so that the
&quot;best&quot; resources spawned in the most dangerous places. My personal
concept of space harvesting is more about mining than scooping, but ultimately
collecting space resources should involve not being able to fight while
harvesting. That presents an interesting decision for a prospector -- how long
do you keep tapping that rich vein of ore when you know that at any second a
band of Evil Pirates might appear over the gray horizon of the asteroid on
which you're crouched?</span></p>
