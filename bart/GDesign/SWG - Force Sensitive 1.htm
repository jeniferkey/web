<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2004/07/10</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Presumably
you developer-type folks long ago worked up the design document for Force
Sensitivity. I doubt that many of the goals for this part of the game have
changed; only the actual mechanics for achieving those goals are in question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But for
us players to do a good job of answering the question of &quot;known vs.
mysterious,&quot; we still need to start by identifying what the goals for this
part of the system are. Once we know that, we can do a better job of suggesting
specific mechanisms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So here's
the top-of-my-head list.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>GOALS
FOR THE PROCESS OF ACTIVATING FORCE SENSITIVITY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(0. The
process must be <i>fun</i>! But this should go without saying.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. The
process must be difficult for each character who attempts it in order to
minimize the number of characters with access to Force skills, who are always
rare in the Star Wars universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. The
process should be ultimately achievable by every character, but immediately
achievable by no character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. The
general path may be known, but the specifics should be mysterious -- not
random, but not deterministic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. The
process should be challenging regardless of a player's innate abilities,
connection speed, number of accounts, or time online. In other words, the
process should be scaled to each <i>character's</i> current skills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>5. The
process should not require camping of any NPC or object. Having a static
location leading to an instanced mission is acceptable, but multiple such
locations would be preferable if this approach must be used at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>6. The
process must clearly incorporate key Star Wars license elements. Given that
becoming a Jedi is one of the two or three most iconic elements of all Star
Wars-related media, becoming Force Sensitive in SWG <i>must</i> have a strong
Star Wars feel to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>7. The
process should expose players (through their characters) to many forms of the
content created for SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Based on
these goals, here's my suggestion for a mechanic to achieve them. I first made
this suggestion several months before SWG launched, and others have offered
their own versions of it (so it's not a new idea); this is just my take on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It comes
down to this: Force Sensitivity Points.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Every
quest, every mission, every distinct action a character takes, may have some
small number of Force Sensitivity Points, or FSPs, assigned to it. The number
of FSPs may be 0 (for a basic action with no moral implications, or a generic
mission with no story elements); it may be moderate (for an action with moral
implications or a mission with some story elements); it may be large (for a
very difficult mission that tells a key part of some Star Wars story, and which
cannot be repeated); it may even be negative (characters should be able to lose
FSPs for choosing actions -- or inaction -- that no Jedi would take).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
character goes about his life in SWG, his FSP total is constantly updated to
reflect the FSPs gained or lost through his in-game behaviors. When (if!) his
FSP total reaches some appropriate number, bingo -- he becomes Force Sensitive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
this approach would achieve each of the goals I listed for the process of
becoming Force Sensitive:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. By
keeping the number of positive FSPs low and/or the required total high, the
difficulty of the process can be made difficult but not impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. By
choosing her character's actions, and in particular what (if any) NPC missions
to take, every player has a chance to eventually make her character Force
Sensitive. But because it's not possible to gain all needed FSPs immediately,
becoming Force Sensitive will take time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. By
keeping the number of FSPs granted by specific actions a closely-held secret,
as well as the &quot;magic number&quot; of FSPs required to become Force
Sensitive, the general path may be well-known (&quot;you have to play like a
Jedi&quot;) while the specific actions necessary remain for the most part not
only mysterious but different for each player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4.
Scaling assigned missions to a character based on that character's current
in-game skills puts all players on a level playing field, and insures that what
matters most is how you actually play your character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>5. If the
number of FSPs provided by NPC missions is generally low, then FSPs can be
spread out over most of the hundreds (thousands!) of current randomly-spawned
missions. Thus no camping of static mission-givers is necessary. However, some
specific missions (probably the highest-value ones) may be created that use
instanced dungeons to minimize camping. Although low-FSP missions should be
spread all over, the high-FSP missions (which will become known) should be
isolated in generally known but slightly randomized locations on the different
planets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>6.
Normally, when a player receives FSPs, he won't know it. He may guess that some
action he's taken has given him some FSPs (positive or negative), but most of
the time there won't be any obvious indication that this has happened. However,
the missions that give large numbers of FSPs (positive or negative) should make
it clear to the player that Force Sensitivity is involved by incorporating key
Star Wars elements into the mission. This would explicitly tell the player that
FSPs are at stake. Not only is this simple fairness to players, it makes
LucasArts happy by being a use of license elements that will be both satisfying
and memorable. The most effective license element in this case will probably be
to let the player's character meet and converse with (or be talked at, if
necessary) one of the advanced Jedi (Light or Dark) from the Star Wars
universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>7. Most
FSP missions -- but in particular those that give moderate levels of FSPs --
should be designed to require players to experience different aspects of SWG.
For example, what appears to be a simple combat mission (&quot;go tranquilize
the rogue falumpaset that's bothering my kaadu herd&quot;) might require the
character to use basic crafting skills to build a specific kind of device
needed to achieve the mission goal, or to interact with a crafter who can do
so. Or a crafting mission could call for the character to travel to an
adventure planet to hire a dancer or doctor, who tells the player something
about that profession. Some missions might need to be solo; some missions might
require grouping. The point is to design these medium-FSP missions to expose
players to different places, professions, and content in SWG.</span></p>
