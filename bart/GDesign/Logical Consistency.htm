<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Game
Worlds Should Be Logically Consistent</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2006/05/19</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I'm perfectly fine with
imaginary worlds that don't share the same physical laws as this Real World of
ours, but I do expect that at a high enough level there's some consistency to the
laws of any world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I qualify that with
&quot;at a high enough level&quot; because I'd even be good with an imagined
world in which different parts of the universe operate under different physical
laws... as long as there's some plausible high-level explanation for that
effect. Maybe (as in more than one fantasy novel) there was a horrific magical
disaster that shattered the universe into multiple planes of existence, each
with its own slightly different physical constants but all interconnected in
the same universe. Or maybe -- and it's conceivable that this is the case even
for our own universe -- the physical constants at the extreme edge of the
expanding universe aren't the same as those at the &quot;center&quot; (wherever
that may be).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>I've read science fiction
and fantasy my entire life; I have no problem wrapping my head around alternate
modes of reality. What I expect from a literary creation of an alternate
reality is that it will be internally self-consistent so as to be effective at
telling a good story. And as a form of literary creation (albeit one with extra
constraints), MMORPGs are not exempt from this expectation. If they have any
interest in telling a good story, a reasonable attention to internal
consistency is mandatory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Where this gets a little
funny is that caveat about &quot;extra constraints.&quot; That being, these
MMORPG things aren't just literary creations -- they also need to succeed as
games. (I think perhaps people don't appreciate just how hard it is to do one
thing well, like make a fun game or tell a good story, much less do both at the
same time.) If you see MMORPGs primarily or exclusively as &quot;just a
game,&quot; then sure, you probably think that caring about consistency is just
a waste of developer time that would be better spent adding new kinds of loot
drops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>But I can, have, and will
argue that to think of MMORPGs as <i>just</i> games is to miss a rare
opportunity to get in on the ground floor of defining a new art form. MMORPGs
are sometimes compared to theme parks because both are about creating a
massively shared entertainment experience. What sets MMORPGs apart from theme
parks is that a MMORPG can do more; because it's just code and data it's easy
to change, giving developers the power to tell a coherent story by defining the
world and its inhabitants at will.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>So for a developer to pass
up that opportunity, for them to always rule in favor of game over world
whenever there's a conflict, is to choose not to participate in exploring the
possibilities of a new kind of art. Being a part of that process means taking
the time to make the world literarily consistent -- there must be reasons why
things are the way they are, and those reasons must be consciously organized in
order to most effectively tell a good story.</span></p>
