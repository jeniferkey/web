<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In 1998
there was an effort (ultimately canceled) to create a massively multiplayer
online game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth milieu.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
process of reading the messages on the forum dedicated to that gane as it was
being designed, I started wondering how &quot;magic&quot; as described by
Tolkien could be translated into a feature of a massively multiplayer game.
Just what did Tolkien mean by magical ability? What forms could Tolkien's
conceptions of &quot;magic&quot; take in a MMOG? What restrictions or revisions
might be necessary to make purely literary effects functional in a
&quot;real&quot; game environment intended to simultaneously satisfy many
players with very diverse expectations? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Back in
1993 I developed a system for categorizing different forms of magical ability
as expressed in fantasy literature. (I've got the original essay on this
particular subject stashed away; maybe I'll dust it off at some point.)
Eventually it occured to me that it should be possible to analyze Tolkien's
Middle-Earth according to this categorization system; maybe doing so would help
in thinking about the high-level strategic implementation questions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First,
let me describe my four-fold categorization of magical ability. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In this
system, magic is classified first as being either innate to individuals, or
else requiring material resources. That is, the source of power is either
&quot;internal&quot; to the magic-user or &quot;external.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Second,
magic can be done either by all members of a society or race, or else the power
is somehow restricted to only certain individuals within that society or race.
In other words, the scope of control is either &quot;some&quot; or
&quot;all.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Considering
these two aspects--the source of power, and the scope of control--leads to a 2
x 2 matrix, and thus to four different styles of magical ability: </span></p>

THE FOUR FORMS DESCRIBED</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A.
Inherited</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the <b>Inherited</b>
form, magic can be done only by some members of a society or race, and the
ability is innate to those individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The most
obvious explanation of this is that the ability is genetic; that is, it is
passed from parent to child. Two examples of this in fantasy literature are the
&quot;Deryni&quot; books by Katherine Kurtz and the &quot;Sunrunner&quot; books
by Melanie Rawn. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
way in which this ability could be transferred might be a form of &quot;laying
on of hands.&quot; It would not be difficult to adapt this concept to the transference
of magical ability, as long as the person transferring the ability must
transfer all of it. (Otherwise this would lead eventually to either a few
terrifically powerful individuals, or else to an entire society of individuals
who have too little ability to accomplish much. While potentially interesting
for a story, this wouldn't adapt well to a multiplayer gaming environment.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By either
of these means, the ability to do magic is restricted to a few persons, and
does not require any resources external to the practitioner. The crucial
element is simply an act of will. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>B.
Innate</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The <b>Innate</b>
form of magical ability is similar to the <b>Inherited</b> form, with the
difference that useful magical ability is available to all members of a society
or race. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As with <b>Inherited</b>
magical ability, all that is required to perform <b>Innate</b> magic is an act
of will. It may or may not require training to direct this force of will in a
useful way, and some individuals are likely to have more willpower than others.
Still, those who possess this innate ability will appear almost supernatural to
other races or societies. To those with no innate magical abilities, an entire
race of beings with such power will seem not so much to do magic as to <em><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>be</span></em> magical. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Among the
somewhat rare examples in fantasy literature of this form of magic ability are
Sheri S. Tepper's &quot;True Game&quot; books and Piers Anthony's stories of
&quot;Xanth.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>C.
Owned</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The <b>Owned</b>
form of magical ability is so-called because the magic is invested in external
objects or resources that must be possessed to be used. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In this
kind of setting, members of the society or race of interest don't actually
&quot;do&quot; magic themselves, but instead use magical items that occur
naturally or are created by others. This is typically the format of the
&quot;heros.&quot; With no innate powers of their own, they must find magical
objects, gain access to them, learn how to use them, and protect them from
being taken by someone else. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
format is often of interest to writers because obvious conflicts arise from it.
For example, what happens to an ordinary person who suddenly becomes the owner
of a powerful magical artifact? How is this person changed by power?
Furthermore, becoming accustomed to wielding power automatically creates the threat
of losing that power, and threats drive plot. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Additionally,
game developers find this kind of magic relatively easy to implement. This is
even more so with the advent of C++, in which magical objects can be
implemented as... well, as objects!) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Magical
devices have been described for centuries, precisely because of the strength of
the notion of conferring power on the weak. Examples of such devices are flying
carpets, cornucopia, enchanted arms and armor, and any number of rings, cloaks,
helms, amulets, potions and scrolls. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Naturally,
stories which use this kind of magic are legion. Examples include &quot;Jack
and the Beanstalk&quot; (magic beans), the Nibelungenlied (finalized in
Wagner's Ring cycle, complete with dwarves, a dragon, a cursed ring, and a
broken sword made whole again), the Arthurian cycle (Excalibur), and even the
the rings in Thorne Smith's <i>The Night Life of the Gods</i> which could turn
people into statues (and vice-versa). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>D.
Learned</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a way,
this is the most mundane of all the forms of magical ability. Here, magic, once
<b>Learned</b>, can be performed by anyone--all that is needed is the
appropriate knowledge. This is one case where knowledge really does equal
power. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In such a
world, magic is treated like we treat science. It is analyzed by theoreticians,
codified into Laws and Rules and Doctrines, and applied by skilled
practitioners... often for money. It is, in short, just one craft among many. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
not to say that some individuals won't have more skill or interest in the craft
of magic than others. For example, anyone in our world who wishes to do so and
has access to teachers may study computer programming. But not everyone cares
to do so, nor does everyone have equal native talent at it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So it is
in the kind of fantasy world that has &quot;Colleges of Magic.&quot; Those
characters who devote themselves to learning magic and are good at it may be
treated with great respect and even awe, as in Ursula K. Le Guin's
&quot;Earthsea&quot; stories. On the other hand, just as some computing
professionals are regarded as geeks for their single-minded dedication to
mastering their craft, it's no stretch to imagine wizards who lack a few social
graces (and who manage to blow themselves up regularly) as in Terry Pratchett's
&quot;Discworld&quot; books. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>However
its practitioners are regarded, the essential distinction of this kind of
magical ability is that one's power is directly proportional to one's
knowledge. This can be played for laughs... but it's also the basis of Mary
Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i> (and any number of lame '50s sci-fi/monster
movies) in which the lust for knowledge unrestrained by humility leads to
disaster. &quot;There are some things Man was never meant to know.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>IV.
APPLICATION TO MIDDLE-EARTH</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So how do
these categories apply to Professor Tolkien's Middle-Earth? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By my
reckoning Tolkien actually used several of the different styles of magical
ability I've described. Each of the different races--including the debased and
evil races that use magic--fits into one of the four categories given above.
(There is one special exception: a kind of magic that appears to be available
to all the races of Middle-Earth, which I will describe later.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A. Men
and Hobbits (and Orcs and Trolls and Goblins, etc.)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a general
rule, Men and Hobbits and members of &quot;lesser&quot; races have no innate
magical ability of their own. Additionally, while they may be able to learn
craft secrets or other lore, they appear to lack the power to apply that
knowledge (as the wizards could). Thus, they can use only <b>Owned</b> magic
(the kind embedded in magical items). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, Bilbo and Frodo could become invisible only by using the Great Ring;
they protected themselves with the shirt of <i>mithril</i>; they attacked with
the enchanted dagger Sting. Samwise could not summon light himself; he required
Galadriel's phial. (Tolkien, in fact, seems to have made a point of describing
Hobbits as far too sensible to bother with that &quot;magic&quot; stuff. This
is what makes Sam's gradual acceptance of magic some of the most fascinating
writing in all of LOTR.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Similarly,
Boromir and other Men did no learned or innate magic themselves. (Aragorn is a
special case, as considered below.) Unlike Hobbits, whom Tolkien portrayed as
not using magic simply because they had no use for it, Tolkien seemed to have a
somewhat less benign view of Man. As I read it, Men did not do magic because
they lacked the necessary greatness of spirit. A very few great-hearted Men
might possess one extremely limited magical ability (such as that of the
Beornings), and one or two other Men might have a special gift to inspire
others as a genetic inheritance from L&uacute;thien, but in general Men are
crude iron to Elvish silver and gold. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Men, like
Hobbits, could and did use items that might be enchanted, such as the
Dragon-Helm of Hador, the reforged Narsil, and perhaps even Boromir's horn. But
the Elvish power to alter reality as an act of will was not among the gifts
given to Man. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

Dwarves</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Dwarves
are a puzzle. They seem, according to the majority of Tolkien's work concerning
them, to have rejected magic almost completely. Dwarves are consistently
described as having great skill in the fashioning of things, an affinity for
caves, a potential for avarice, and very touchy senses of honor (with long
memories where their honor is concerned)... but in all of this, Tolkien shows
us no scenes of Dwarves doing magic. It is thus easy to conclude that Dwarves,
like Men and Hobbits, were purely mundane, and that any appearance of magical
ability in them is due to their unsurpassed craft. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, while Gandalf has a conversation with Gimli before the locked door of
Moria concerning dwarven craft, what the Dwarves do is not explicitly described
by Tolkien as &quot;magical.&quot; Gandalf speaks of Dwarven doors that open at
certain times or for certain individuals, or by speaking certain words such as
those of the secret Dwarf-speech, but none of these things are necessarily
magical. It's not unreasonable to ascribe them to great craft, such as that
used to create the secret entrance to Mt. Erebor: &quot;...the setting sun with
the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But this
mundane appearance may be deceiving. Although Tolkien (to my knowledge) never
directly shows Dwarves doing what he portrays as magic, or even using magical
items, there are a few off-stage references to both of these. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There is
the acceptance by the Dwarf-lords of the seven Rings forged for them by the
elven-smiths of Eregion. Although this might be explained away as a matter of
the Dwarvish instinct to hoard valuable things, Sauron could only have
entrapped the wearers if they had worn the seven rings and used their powers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
somewhat clearer example of Dwarven magic use is the work of the great smith,
Telchar of Nogrod. For one thing, Telchar forged the Helm of Hador. As Tolkien
says of this, &quot;...on it were graven runes of victory. A power was in it
that guarded any who wore it from wound or death, for the sword that hewed it
was broken, and the dart that smote it sprang aside.&quot; For another example,
Telchar forged Narsil, the blade reforged for Aragorn as And&uacute;ril. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
reasonable argument could be made that the &quot;magical&quot; appearance of
these items was merely due to their having been made with an almost miraculous
level of skill. (I held to just this argument for some time.) But an equally
reasonable reading of Tolkien suggests that he intended for these items to be
regarded as possessing magical powers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What finally
tipped the balance for me in accepting that some Dwarves could indeed do magic
(if only the limited kind of imbuing artifacts with special virtues) was the
Unexpected Party at Bag End in <i>The Hobbit</i>. When Thorin Oakenshield and
the other twelve Dwarves are introduced to Bilbo through Gandalf's guile, they
sing a song which includes the verse: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Garamond'>The dwarves of yore made mighty spells</span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><code><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Garamond'>While hammers fell like ringing bells</span></code></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And if
that's not clear enough, Tolkien immediately follows this song by stating that
Bilbo &quot;...felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning
and by magic moving through him...&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Was this
merely a bit of poetic license on Tolkien's part? After all, <i>The Hobbit</i>
is widely considered a rather lightweight bit of whimsy, not really
&quot;canon&quot; like <i>The Silmarillion</i> or <i>Narn i H&icirc;n
H&uacute;rin</i>. But I believe that this should be taken just as Prof. Tolkien
stated it--as evidence (not conclusive, perhaps, but supportive) that some
Dwarves could indeed perform a kind of magic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Still,
perhaps this was merely an unintended artifact of Tolkien's story-telling.
Given the many years in which Tolkien's tale &quot;grew in the telling,&quot;
it should not be surprising that perfect consistency was impossible, not to
mention subsidiary to literary considerations. And yet, there it is. Tolkien
said that Dwarves cast spells; they did magic. Do we toss aside these
statements simply because they appear in <i>The Hobbit</i>? How can we ignore
them (because they inconveniently do not fit a theory) without casting doubt on
so many other questions? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I think
we can't. So, considering all the evidence as fairly as I can, I'm prepared to
say that, while most Dwarves never did anything magical nor desired to do so, a
very few of the most learned and skillful Dwarves could perform feats of
craftsmanship indistiguishable from magic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Call it

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The Elves
are a different matter. Unlike Men and Hobbits, who have only <b>Owned</b>
ability, and Dwarves, who have only a limited form of <b>Learned</b> magical
ability, I classify Elves as having the <b>Innate</b> magical ability. (The
Ents and Tom Bombadil probably also fit into this category.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For the
Elves, magic is clearly an act of will. While immense will may be necessary for
magics beyond simple illusion, the essential ability to do such magic appears
to be available to all Elves described by Tolkien. In this, they are akin to
the Valar--and even to Eru, the One--in that all that is necessary for a thing
to happen is that it be willed strongly enough. Just as Il&uacute;vatar made
the world, and the Valar (and Melkor) shaped it, the Elves are able to alter
the physical world in accordance with their desires. While those Elves who saw
the light of the Two Trees were among the most powerful, even the Green-elves
of Ossiriand and the Wood-elves of Mirkwood had access to this power simply by
virtue of being Elves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>With one
exception, the Elves relied on this innate force of will to work their wonders,
rather than on using magical items or on special knowledge. The exception is
the tribe of the Noldor in general, and F&euml;anor, Curufin, and Celebrimbor
specifically. (In addition, Galadriel, herself a Noldo, gets into the business
of making artifacts, as in the shining glass she gives to Frodo.) Even Professor
Tolkien seems a bit puzzled as to why these Elves delighted in the making of
things which required great craft and skill; in several passages he suggests
that other Elves considered the Noldor a bit odd. (And of course there was that
bit of nastiness at Alqualond&euml; to further set them apart.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Still,
Tolkien makes it clear that these Elves were the exceptions, not the rule.
While the Noldor (particularly the children of F&euml;anor) had a special gift of
craft, what set the Firstborn apart from all the other races was their burning
spirit that could make what was willed real. In fact, this instinctive magical
ability common to all Elves was required for the making of the Silmarils and
the Rings of Power by particularly skilled Noldorin Elves. So it seems fair to
suppose that the Elves are best described as using the <b>Innate</b> kind of
magic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There is,
I should add, an alternate explanation. It may be that the power of Light magic
is not innate to Elves, but is instead divine power of the Valar that may be
loaned to Elves upon request. Perhaps the apparent ability of the Elves to use
this kind of magic &quot;on demand&quot; is because the Valar can better hear
the great-spirited Firstborn than any of the other races of Middle-Earth.
Practically, however, the results are the same: Elves can <b>Innate</b>ly do
magic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then
there are the Istari--the wizards. Unlike the other races, Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast
and the others seem to gain their powers (and their relative positions in the
wizardly hierarchy) by the development and exercise of craft and skill--in a
word, through what is <b>Learned</b>. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Lin
Carter (in <i>Tolkien: A Look Behind the Lord of the Rings</i>) observes that
Tolkien may have based the character of Gandalf on the Norse All-Father, Odin.
Where this becomes interesting is when it is recalled that much of Odin's power
was described as being due to his vast knowledge. In one story, Odin trades an eye
for a drink at the giant Mimir's well, but in so doing, he acquires wisdom.
Odin was also said to have had two great ravens, Hugin and Munin
(&quot;Thought&quot; and &quot;Memory&quot;), who would fly off into the world
and return with secrets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some of
this seems to fit Gandalf and the other wizards pretty closely. Radagast the
Brown, for example, gets information from his friends in the animal kingdom.
And just as Odin's wisdom was bought through the pain of losing an eye, the
power of Gandalf grew the greater through the pain of his grappling with the
Balrog. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If
another clue is needed, consider: one of the names given to Saruman was
&quot;Curun&iacute;r&quot;--the Man of Skill. The root &quot;curu-&quot; or
&quot;skill&quot; is also found in the place-name &quot;Nan
Curun&iacute;r,&quot; or &quot;Wizard's Vale.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Taking all
these things into account, Tolkien's wizards appear to be best described as
using the <b>Learned</b> style of magical ability. (This raises the related
questions: &quot;What did they learn?&quot; and &quot;How did they apply this
knowledge?&quot; But Tolkien offers no answers to these questions.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
suggested earlier that there may be a special kind of magic available to all
the inhabitants of Middle-Earth. Specifically, members of any race, in extreme
situations, may to be able to invoke the powers of light (the Valar?) to defy
the forces of darkness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>At
various points in Professor Tolkien's long history of Middle-Earth, several
characters in desperate circumstances cry out in supplication. In most cases,
when granted this aid is not tangible, but rather is no more--and no less--than
a bit of extra strength with which to resist yielding to despair. And in a few
cases, this aid does take the somewhat tangible form of light. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It might
seem to be a bit of a stretch to call these apparent interventions &quot;magic,&quot;
but that is how Tolkien uses them. When the words &quot;Gilthoniel, A
Elbereth!&quot; come unbidden to the mind of a hobbit as earthy and sensible as
Sam Gamgee, and an oppressive force of evil retreats at those words (the
Watchers at the Tower of Cirith Ungol), it's reasonable to accept that Tolkien
intended this to be understood as magical. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although
to my current knowledge Tolkien does not show any explicit examples of Men or
Dwarves using this kind of magic, he doesn't state that it is denied to them. Suggestions
that certain Men might have access to a kind of natural magical power may be
found in Aragorn's healing ability, or his calling up and commanding the Shadow
Host from the Paths of the Dead. But there is a more likely reason: Aragorn's
power, like his noble bearing, may have been a gift to the descendants of
L&uacute;thien Tin&uacute;viel through his ancestor Elros, who although
Halfelven chose to become mortal. Further support for this interpretation comes
when Tolkien, during the Mouth of Sauron's conversation with Aragorn before the
Black Gate, mentions that &quot;Black N&uacute;men&oacute;reans&quot; also
descended from L&uacute;thien were &quot;enamoured of evil knowledge.&quot; And
this Messenger himself is said to have &quot;learned great sorcery.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(If this
notion is accepted, it may be that the descendants of Elros have a limited form
of the fourth kind of magical ability, that which is <b>Inherited</b>. Given
Tolkien's description of the waning of the D&uacute;nedain, the genes
responsible for this kind of magical ability are apparently recessive. So we
might as well assume that this kind of magic is not available to the current
inhabitants of Middle-Earth in the Fourth Age.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
apparent contradiction in the magical abilities of Men might be explained if
Tolkien used the term &quot;sorcery&quot; to refer to power exercised by craft
(reserved generally to the Istari and in a specific form to the most skillful
Dwarves), and the word &quot;magic&quot; to refer to power derived from
invoking the names of the Valar and those beloved by them. I'm not familiar
with any such explicit differentiation by Tolkien, but perhaps someone else can
shed some light on this notion. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Generally,
though, even if Men and Hobbits were thought by Tolkien to have the ability to
invoke a feeling of Good in desperate straits or to learn dark sorceries,
Tolkien seems to have preferred that individual members of these two races live
or die on their own without doing innate magic. They might use magical items,
but the special gift of innate magical ability was, except in extremely limited
cases, denied them. </span></p>

multiplayer game around them? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The bad
news is that a massively multiplayer gaming environment based on Tolkien's
Middle-Earth cannot offer players a wide range of magical abilities and still
remain true to Tolkien's vision of the strengths and weaknesses of the various
races. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
foremost practitioners of what we commonly recognize as &quot;magic&quot; were
the wizards. But the developers of the on-line version of Middle-Earth have
already stated that players will not be allowed to be wizards as described by
Tolkien. So either major-league spell-casting is out, or the developers will
have to alter Professor Tolkien's vision to a significant degree. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This goes
deeper than the obvious question of whether players can be allowed to be
wizards or not. Not only did Tolkien restrict to the wizards the magical
ability that we think of as spell-casting, but he explicitly portrayed
Middle-Earth as a world in which magic was fading. The Ainur descended into the
world to become the Valar and Maiar, the Valar and Maiar gave way to the Eldar,
and the Eldar left the world to Men. Even evil waned in grandeur as Melkor
became Morgoth, and was replaced by his still-less-noble lieutenant, Sauron.
And the Third Age ended with the unmaking of the Great Ring and the passing
from the world of the three Elven Rings and their bearers (including Galadriel,
the last Elf in the living world to have seen the light of the Two Trees). In
their passing, they took with them the last great magics of Middle-Earth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To now
reintroduce strong magic to Middle-Earth for no other reason than because
paying customers want to cast spells would run completely counter to Tolkien's
view of his world as consistently becoming more mundane over time. There may be
valid Real World economic reasons for computer game developers to make such a
fundamental change. But it is fair to point out that doing so would contradict
the stated intention of the designers to hew as closely as possible to
Middle-Earth as imagined by Tolkien. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
not the only potential problem concerning magic use. Unless Tolkien's concepts
of racial gifts are radically altered, those races whose members generally have
no natural ability to do magic--Men, Hobbits, and Dwarves--will gain the use of
magic only if new kinds of magic undescribed by Tolkien are invented and
introduced (alchemy, for example), or if the landscape is littered with
hitherto-unknown caches of Elven magical items. (Maybe the barrow-wights are
breeding.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Otherwise,
the only race that will be able to do magic will be the local Wood-elves, and
even they will be limited to their innate magical resistance to forces of
darkness. This would mean that they'd be great to have in a party that
encounters some form of evil, but against some natural danger (a bear, for example)
they would have no special magic to contribute beyond innate physical
abilities. Someone playing an Elf would be limited in most situations to
wielding a sword or firing arrows as little more than a slightly more effective
version of any mundane Man or Dwarf or Hobbit. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And
because the last of the Noldor will have left, even the skillful crafting of
magical items will be very limited. Following Tolkien's hints, by the Fourth
Age it wouldn't even be possible to do magic in non-combat settings (which in
most MMOGs accounts for significant playing time). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If we can
suppose that the <b>Inherited</b> form of magical ability existed among at
least some of the D&uacute;nedain, it would likely be essentially extinct by
the beginning of the Fourth Age. Even if possible in Tolkien's literary world,
however, it likely would not be permitted to game players, since if it were
possible, everyone who played a human would claim descent from N&uacute;menor.
It's more likely and more reasonable to give human players access to the <b>Owned</b>
ability that comes from using magical items, and provide a sufficient number
and kind of such items to motivate good gameplay. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Meanwhile,
Elves (and possibly some player classes/professions) would have some limited
access to the <b>Innate</b> form of magic. It's possible that human players
could be allowed access to <b>Learned</b> magic, as this would leave Elves in
sole possession of <b>Innate</b> magic without denying those playing human
characters the opportunity to &quot;do magic.&quot; But to do so would run counter
to Tolkien's conception of &quot;magic&quot; (in the form of Fa&euml;rie)
leaving Middle-Earth at the end of the Third Age. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
result of all this is that to create a massively multiplayer game based on
Middle-Earth that allows players to do interesting magic will require either
severe modifications of Middle-Earth as Tolkien created it, or severe limits on
gameplay to preserve Tolkien's vision of the peoples and places and events of
Middle-Earth. </span></p>

choices are perilous. If you alter the well-known racial abilities and social
demographics of the peoples of Middle-Earth at the start of the Fourth Age, you
will be rewriting Tolkien in ways of which Tolkien would certainly not have
approved, and to which the many fans of the original story will certainly object,
possibly by not playing. Otherwise, the game will have to be set at some time
prior to the end of the Third Age, in which case you won't have certain key

and hope found in Tolkien's work are expunged in favor of levelling up by
killing orcs. </span></p>
