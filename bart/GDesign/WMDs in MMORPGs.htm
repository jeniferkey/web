<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/10/17</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There’s
been some talk recently about a &quot;doomsday device&quot; in EVE Online. Apparently
it's possible -- with the expenditure of a lot of time and 160 billion or so of the local
currency -- to create a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) in the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But is
that really possible? Does something like that have a similar effect in today’s
online games as the (unfortunately) real thing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
&quot;Doomsday device&quot; isn't an accurate description of a WMD unless it's
capable of offing a significant (25% - 50% or more) percentage of the
population.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. What
gives WMDs their power isn't just the destructive capability of one weapon --
it's the threat that where there's one, there may be many more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It was to
generate this perception that two bombs were dropped in 1945, rather than just
one. One could be a fluke; two implies a repeatable process, which is far more
dangerous than any individual weapon (unless it really is a doomsday device).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. The
power of WMDs is not in their power to destroy military assets, but in their
political effects on civilian populations. In other words, WMDs are a strategic
weapon, not a tactical weapon. To think of them only as tactical weapons is to
fail to get full value from the time and money spent building them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. A big
difference between using WMDs in the real world and using them in online games
is that most (pretty much all?) online games don't have anything like civilian
populations. There may be a few NPCs, but that's nothing like the tens of
millions of souls that general serious economic and political power. A few
hundred NPCs who act only as isolated loot pinatas are not even remotely
similar to millions of NPCs coordinating their actions in ways that have real
effects on gameplay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the ideas I've been mulling over for a MMORPG is to integrate it with a sim
game. Part of the gameplay would be managing the political, economic, and
social happiness of billions of simulated citizens spread over several worlds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Wouldn't
a game world like that be a lot more conducive to the application of a WMD? A
WMD in one of the current player-heavy MMORPGs gets used more like a tactical
weapon; it just kills (temporarily) a few players. Eventually players just
shrug that off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's when
keeping millions of civilians happy matters that the possibility of some Bad
Guys having a WMD becomes a real gameplay motivator. WMDs can only realize
their full terrifying potential in an online world where WMDs can be a
strategic-level threat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But here’s
the question: Would that be &quot;fun?&quot;</span></p>
