<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Over the
nearly two years since SWG launched, it's become more and more obvious that the
developers see it as being first and foremost a combat game. There's crafting
and entertaining and healing and a player economy, but those things only exist
to support combat players. So the enhancements they've received have been
trivial compared to the &quot;content&quot; (Geonosian caves, Corellian
Corvette, Deathwatch Bunker, Hero of Tatooine Quest, etc., etc.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So over
the months, SWG has become less and less interesting. I mastered Artisan and
Merchant quickly, but gained Scout, Marksman Pistol, and Creature Handler
skills very slowly because I choose not to grind for XP. Consequently I don't
have as wide experience of SWG as other players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Still,
I've explored all the planets, attended a wedding, survived a couple of
schematic quests, flown in space, mined a lot of resources, crafted a lot of
things, sold some things, shot some things, and met some nice people. So, in
the spirit of the day, I thought I'd offer my own limited experiences with the
Combat Upgrade and some conclusions based on those experiences.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Take
these reactions for what they're worth: just personal observations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Painful,
painful, painful. I absolutely would still be trying (and failing) to load the
CU patch files if not for TSR-Chad (thanks!) and his <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=Techsupport&amp;message.id=225604&amp;query.id=0#M225604">links</a>
to the files on the patch server, and for a fast connection at work that I was
able to use. There is no way SOE cares about dialup users when they create
patch files that are 100MB in size. (Apparently the money of people with dialup
modems is somehow less valuable than that of broadband users.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Creature
Handler Profession</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
maximum level of the fambaa pet that I worked for months to learn to tame has
been reduced, but other (smaller) creatures weren't reduced. Other creature
levels seem to have been reduced as well, such as the kliknik defender that's
now just level 22.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm no
longer able to call some of the pets in my datapad. In particular I can't call
the level 38 huurton howler I tamed. One possible reason is that I wear a
&quot;muscle shirt&quot; with an attachment for +12 Taming Wild Creatures and
+12 Taming Vicious Creatures. Although my current Creature Taming level is 34,
I was able to tame huurton howlers using this shirt. Now I can't even call this
creature out of my datapad -- I get a &quot;You can not tame this creature at
your current level&quot; type message. (Verified in <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=creature_handler&amp;message.id=218063">Creature
Handler FAQ V5</a>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>250,000
XP are required for a tier 3 CH skill, while a tier 4 requires 350,000 XP. I
took on a Gungan Outcast last night with a shaupaut hunter and a half-grown
fambaa -- after my fambaa was more than half-dead, I earned 634 CH XP.
(Apparently I should be happy it wasn't just 1 XP.) At that rate, given that I
have 10 skill boxes of the 18 in CH, I would do better to use the
tame-and-release method (except for the massive lethality of every planet in
SWG now unless you're a Master of some elite combat profession). And at the
rate of 1100 XP per creatures, that's 228 creatures I'll have to tame for the
next tier 3 skill -- call it roughly 1800 creatures I'll have to
tame-and-release to master CH. If I could tame 50 creatures a night (a wildly
overoptimistic estimate), it would take me over a month if I played SWG every
night and did nothing but tame babies. If I tried to do anything else, my
average number of tamings would drop to something closer to 10 per night...
which amounts to half a year to master one profession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And for
what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As
Vertexon reported the devs saying in <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=creature_handler&amp;message.id=227776">their
response</a> to some questions: &quot;unfortunately with the balance system it
is no longer practical to have multiple pets of varying levels in use at one
time.&quot; So unless you've ground enough CH skills to have tamed some
uberpet,&nbsp; there's no point in maintaining a menagerie. (Using the
&quot;right&quot; pet for a particular job? Umm... no. Combat level <i>über
alles</i>!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Dabbling&quot;
in CH -- in other words, learning CH skills because it's fun and useful to have
a wide range of abilities -- now seems even less worthwhile than it was before
the CU. As others have noted, there's no point to learning just a few CH
skills; creature handling is only fun and useful once you've mastered the
entire profession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I guess
I'm done with CH.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Pistoleer
Profession</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
Novice Pistoleer skill now requires the entire Marksman Pistols tier and the
entire Marksman Ranged tier. I was closing in on Novice Pistoleer... and poof!
now I'm not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On a
positive note: the range at which aggressive mobs detect you seems to have been
decreased. I had to get within nearly 25m of the Gungan Outcast before he
noticed me -- this is considerably less than his pre-CU aggro range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Weapon
damage has been massively decreased. Pre-CU I could do 1000 with a good
Overcharge or Kip-Up shot with my Republic Blaster, now all I've got that I can
use is a CDEF that I made myself (with my best resources) for 62 damage (and
the Overcharge and Kip-Up abilities have been removed). The Gungan Outcast had
about 3000 health -- at 62 damage per shot, I'd have to have landed nearly 50
shots to nail him, but of course I'd have been incapped long before then.
(Having a half-grown fambaa pet tanking was the only thing that saved me.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A full
tier of Marksman Pistol skills and 1 Ranged skill gives me a combat level of
31... and unless I can survive long enough to find someone who is willing to
sell a Geonosian Sonic Blaster or Tangle Pistol (and doesn't want more than
1Mcr for it), or I'm willing to settle for a lesser pistol than I can now
wield, all I can do is a measly 62 damage? I understand that the CU was
supposed to make combat more interesting for the hardcore combat player, but
was no thought whatsoever given to allowing the non-hardcore to survive long
enough to achieve the higher levels?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The HAM
box now shows the player's numeric combat level and some icon. Apparently I
have a choice of icons (Marksman, Artisan, Medic, and &quot;Utility&quot;).
What's &quot;utility&quot;? Is the icon currently selected visible to other
players as some kind of &quot;here's what I can contribute to a group&quot;
indicator?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So the
HAM box now has combat level info, and perhaps a grouping interest icon... is
there any purpose in these beyond combat? If my combat level is considered so
important that it must always be displayed, what am I supposed to think about
my value as a crafter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I agree
with the posters who don't like the new icons. My eyesight is lousy, so with
all the color and detail the new icons are too &quot;busy&quot; for me to
recognize without putting my face about half an inch away from the monitor...
which detracts somewhat from the entertainment experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I also
agree with the posters who've observed that combat is now more about watching
the timer on your combat icons than watching the fight. In other words, post-CU
combat is now about playing the interface. How can we engage in <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=csystems&amp;message.id=18212&amp;highlight=#M18212">tactical</a>
or <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=csystems&amp;message.id=42277&amp;highlight=#M42277">stealth</a>
decision-making if we're so focused on the user interface that we run into
trees? Having the combat queue was demonstrably superior to this approach.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Conclusion</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A sneaky
suspicion came to me as I was being mauled by a low-level NPC: perhaps the
Combat Upgrade deliberately implemented things that players clearly don't like
(hard-to-read icons, combat queue elimination, insta-kill for non-combat
players) because making ground combat less fun will push players back into
space... where they can be persuaded to fork over more cash for the &quot;Rage
of the Wookiees&quot; expansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Just a
theory, of course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ultimately,
I think this is probably the last straw for me. I was active on SOE's official
pre-launch forum for nearly a year before SWG actually shipped -- I've been a
constructive supporter of this game (and have the <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=csystems&amp;message.id=40247&amp;highlight=#M40247">posts</a>
to prove it) for nearly three years of my life. But between the years of
&quot;let them eat cake&quot; disregard for the interests of non-combat
players, the unending series of bugs due to failing to properly test changes
(and to act responsibly on test results before publishing), and what seems to
be a single-minded &quot;we'll give you what we want and you'll keep paying for
it&quot; attitude, it's enough. Why should I keep playing SWG, or for that
matter anything that SOE might make? Frankly, if the attitude of SOE is any
example, I'm not sure I'm even interested in investing more of my time in any
multiplayer online game ever again -- that's how unhappy I've become with the
direction that SWG's producers have taken it since it launched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's sad
that one set of developers can destroy the joy of an entire entertainment form.
SWG should have captured the fun of the original source of their license -- the
Star Wars milieu. It should have made every Star Wars fanatic frantic to buy a
computer and go online. Instead, it squandered the one-of-a-kind license (and
SWG's very good initial design) by catering to flavor-of-the-month,
kill-it-before-it-dies console gamers. SOE insists on trying to satisfy the
wrong market segment, and refuses to even consider the possibility that it
might be mistaken in continuing to court this group. Instead of being the game
that brought the millions of Star Wars fans online, SWG became just another
fighting game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What a
disappointment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So, like
OrionSeven, I'll probably become what SOE considers the perfect player: someone
who doesn't play SWG any more because it's not fun, but who continues to fork
over $15/month in the hope that some SWG producer will, some day, actually
&quot;get it.&quot; Hope keeps me here; hope that someone at SOE will have the
courage to take the necessary actions to turn SWG back into what it started off
as and should have remained: a rich game world dedicated to the proposition
than all fans of Star Wars deserve content they can enjoy, and that creating
such features would result in a better game for everyone.</span></p>
