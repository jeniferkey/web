<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Are MMOGs
unfair to some players?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Talking about &quot;fairness&quot; requires asking the question: fairness to
whom?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Around
whose idea of fairness should a MMOG be designed? Should the game be structured
to be fair to (i.e., to provide rewards to) the smart, persistent, socially
connected player? Or should it be designed to be fair to the average, casual,
independent player?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Political
conservatives often feel that their liberal friends misunderstand the concept
of fairness. Conservative theorists like to point out that there's a difference
between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. From their
perspective, defining fairness as equality of opportunity is preferable because
rewarding effort yields positive results for a society; defining fairness as
equality of outcome damages a society because it devalues effort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Following
this philosophy, the optimal MMOG environment would have equality of
opportunity for all players, but would not try to guarantee equality of
outcome. Every player would have the same chances to create a &quot;good&quot;
character, to fully explore the game's content, and to join a guild. And from
those voluntary actions, players are free to reap the benefits of smart,
persistent, and organized action. &quot;Fairness&quot; means that those who put
in the effort get the most rewards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Isn't
this pretty much the situation we have now in most MMOGs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I think a
good argument could be made that it is. Although I'd discourage anyone from
leaping into the Michael Moore fantasyland on this, I believe it's probably
fair to conclude that the Pareto effect shows up many MMOGs with strong player
economies because these game economies are designed around the conservative
&quot;equality of opportunity&quot; philosophy of fairness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MMOGs
that embrace the conservative assumption that effort should be rewarded wind up
with power law distributions of economic assets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. <i>I
think we should elect game developers into positions of political leadership.
Especially over the economy.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Oh, dear
God, no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
reason we have questions of fairness coming up with respect to MMOGs is because
the efforts at social engineering that constitute MMOG design are surprisingly
short-sighted. The whole idea of MMOGs is that they're &quot;massively
multiplayer,&quot; but where's the testing that would reveal how a few smart,
hard-working, and organized players can so quickly dominate an entire server's
economy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If a
game's economy isn't consciously designed to produce equality of outcome, why
should anyone be surprised when a relatively small number of players is able to
dominate that economy? If there aren't features imposed that &quot;punish&quot;
the hard-working players in order to flatten out the power curve, why be
surprised that the average, casual, solo player complains that the game is
&quot;unfair?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Those who
practice social engineering in politics (whether from the Left or the Right)
are very bad at it. But they're still demonstrably more effective than MMOG
designers, who always seem startled when a few players take over a server.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
latter aren't people I want trying to impose social engineering on a grand scale,
no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. How
much of the dramatic shape of the power curve in MMOG economies is due
primarily to their laser-like focus on Achiever gameplay?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When you
design a game in which the most prevalent form of reward by far is
&quot;stuff&quot; of one kind or another (XP, skill level or character level,
money, loot, rank, badges, etc., etc.), you dramatically sharpen the shape of
the power distribution curve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you
build an accumulation game, the Achievers will come. And they will bring with
them their certainty that fairness means equality of opportunity, not equality
of outcome, and you will get the Pareto effect in spades.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. Well,
what about actively trying to flatten the curve?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If
designers placed caps on how much and how quickly rewards could accrue from effort,
or defied convention by consciously offering social and exploratory gameplay
comparable in power to commercial and combat gameplay, or offered few
accumulatable rewards, would it work? Would it be a fun game?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Would it
be a commercially successful game? Would hardcore players want to play a game
where the &quot;weak&quot; are rewarded, where fairness is defined to be
equality of outcome?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is there
a functional middle ground between equality of opportunity (power law) and
equality of outcome (flip a coin)?</span></p>
