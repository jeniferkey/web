<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So far I
definitely approve of the Imperial crackdown -- it's a much-needed boost to the
Star Warsy-ness of this game. I thought I'd share a couple of the experiences
I've had that lead me to this conclusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My first
sign that something was different came a few minutes after I logged in for the
first time following the Imperial Crackdown code patches. I had just stepped
outside the front door of my house to check on a wind harvester when I heard an
odd sound... the sound of a starship. &quot;That's funny,&quot; I thought.
&quot;How can there be ships out here? I'm nowhere near a city.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As I
looked around, I realized that a Lambda-class shuttle had just landed a few
meters away. Suddenly out from the back of the shuttle poured a column of
Imperial stormtroopers!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As the
shuttle took off, I ran back to my house. (I'm neutral, but these guys might
not appreciate that, I thought.) From my doorstep, I could see the troopers
lined up in a formation, not moving. They didn't seem inclined to open fire on
me, and they didn't appear to be coming after me to check my ID, so after a minute
or two I calmed down and went back to my usual routine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Following
this I needed to go to Tatooine. While I was there I visited Mos Espa... but I
don't recommend it. First, it took so long to log in there after the shuttle
trip that I thought my link had gone dead. When I finally appeared, there were
so many Imperial troops milling around in the street that my frame rate
plummeted to approximately 1 frame per second. Trying to move was so painful I
headed back onto the shuttle as quickly as possible. It was nice to see the
strong Imperial presence, but the frame rate just can't survive the number of
troopers in Mos Espa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>OK, now
jump forward a day. I'm back in my home on Naboo after the trip to Tatooine,
and I've just logged back in. I walk outside to check on my equipment factory
when I see five or six Maulers on the other side. I try to sneak up to my
factory, hoping that the Maulers (like Trade Avengers and swamp rats) will
continue not to notice me like they haven't for the past few weeks... but it's
no good; they aggro on me and start firing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I can
just barely hold my own against a full Mauler if I'm lucky, but there were a
pair of them after me. I raced back to my house... when with a shock I realized
<i>the stormtroopers were still there</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then
a funny idea occured to me. On my way back home from Tatooine a different group
of Maulers had chased me into a nest of shaupauts. After I'd managed to get
away I noticed that the shaupauts had attacked the Maulers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now here
was another bunch of Maulers after me... and another group of mobs who could
protect themselves was nearby. &quot;Hey, maybe stormtroopers don't like
Maulers, either,&quot; I thought, and with the Maulers on my heels I changed
course and ran right into the middle of the stormtrooper formation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
seconds, my prayers were answered as every trooper opened fire. Weapons
blazing, the troopers converged on the Maulers. After thirty seconds of
brightly colored laser bolts filling the air, both Maulers were smoking corpses
on my front lawn. Briefly raising their hands into the air in celebration, the
stormtroopers then calmly returned to their staging area by my front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Great!&quot;
I thought. &quot;I can just keep leading the Maulers back here, and the
stormtroopers will finish them off for me.&quot; But no. After a moment's
pause, every stormtrooper continued walking... straight into the river that
flows in front of my house. In seconds, what had been a crack squad of
death-dealing Imperial warriors had become a water ballet team, complete with
synchronized swimming moves straight out of an Ethel Merman movie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><img
border=0 width=800 height=640 src="waterballet_01.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Fortunately
for me the stormtroopers had called in a few of their pals to the other side of
my house. In a small group were a couple of lieutenants, an exterminator, a
swamp trooper, and a random stormtrooper. So for thirty minutes I led
respawning Maulers to their doom -- I'd wander over, get one or two of them to
aggro on me, and lead them back to the Imperials who made short work of them.
Eventually the Maulers quit respawning and I was able to manage my factory in
peace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Bottom
line: I'm no longer afraid of being harassed by Imperial troops. Rather than
fearing them, I now regard these stormtroopers as my own personal home security
system. Cool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One other
funny thing happened, however. As I was checking some harvesters on the other
bank of the river (where the Imperial water ballet team was still in action), a
rogue faamba appeared. Given my pretty good /maskscent I wasn't worried for my
personal safety, but I did notice that the swimming stormtroopers seemed to be
getting closer and closer to the faamba.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sure
enough, they finally got a little too close for the faamba's comfort, and he
waded into the water. Suddenly the stormtroopers realized their peril and
opened fire. Oddly, they were able to do so while in the water -- they'd stand
up as though they were on land, fire one shot, then go back to swimming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><img
border=0 width=800 height=640 src="waterballet_02.jpg"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Eventually
the faamba succumbed to the massed fire of the stormtroopers... at which point
they went right back to their synchronized swimming routine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So
developers -- for all the grief and whining you get from this board, here's one
player who's fairly pleased with what you've accomplished in the Imperial
crackdown. Please keep on coming up with such interesting NPC behaviors!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Especially
if they help me stay in business.</span></p>
