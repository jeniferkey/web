<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Typically
all we get in a MMOG is tactics... and not really even much of that because so
few environmental factors are implemented. (Picking which special actions to
spam at your PvP opponent while he does the same to you is not tactics. At
best, you might call it &quot;sub-tactical.&quot;) Line of sight is usually
implemented, so sometimes you can hide behind a tree, but how many MMOGs do you
know that really implement stealth? How many MMOGs allow you to ambush a column
from the cover of trees alongside a road in the dark, firing in enfilade from
concealed positions and cutting off their line of retreat with pre-placed
mines? How would you respond if you were the lieutenant in command of a platoon
that got ambushed like this? That's tactics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even
those MMOGs that offer something like this rarely also support operational
play. Usually that's a matter of guilds that plan raids, which is completely up
to the players. There's no in-game support for this kind of company- to battalion-level
activity. This is the level where you start benefiting from focused staff:
Intelligence (S2) to acquire information about the battlefield environment and
design counterintelligence operations, Operations (S3) to plan tactical
engagements and conduct training, and Logistics (S4) to insure that supply,
transportation, maintenance and services are adequate for any eventuality. I'd
really like to see a MMOG that was rich enough for players to be able to do
these kinds of things meaningfully. With them it would be possible to carry out
sustained actions over more than just one night's play. Without them, the
tactical engagement you enjoy today never even happened tomorrow. And that runs
counter to the desire expressed by so many players to be able to &quot;make a
difference&quot; in the game world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then
there's strategy. This is the level of the brigade, the division, the corps,
and the army. This is where the comment that Napoleon supposedly made that
&quot;an army travels on its stomach&quot; comes into play, and where someone
who (like George C. Marshall) is capable of consistently maneuvering the right
resources to the right place at the right time over a long stretch of time can
win a war, and can do it decisively. It's not just movie fiction that General George
S. Patton was able to disengage part of his Third Army from an enemy force,
turn it ninety degrees and march two days through drifting snow, and engage in
operations to relieve the besieged 101st Airborne defending what was left of Bastogne. He could do it because he could think strategically; he already had plans for
doing it before he needed it because the capability to do it was always a part
of his strategy for winning. He planned in advance as best he could, and
maneuvered all the resources he could get into position ahead of time as often
as he could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Has there
ever been any MMOG developed that allowed some player the chance to exercise
that level of long-term, large-scale command?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If some
developer were to create a MMOG that truly allowed this strategic level of
gameplay, I would be forced to sell my home and live off the proceeds in a
cheap motel room with a phone line until they threw me into the street, because
I would never stop playing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And as I
lay in the gutter clutching my now-worthless computer to my chest in the
driving rain, I would be thinking, &quot;Man, that's a cool game.&quot;</span></p>
