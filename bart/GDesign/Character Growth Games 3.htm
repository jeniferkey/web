<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>This industry is desperately in need of a MMORPG that's
about actually playing a character, not grinding to grow a character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>It seems to me that the single most common cause of grinding
in MMORPGs is the design choice of giving characters &quot;levels&quot; that
determine the character's abilities and that can be increased to allow
characters to improve their abilities. Designers appear to be accepting without
question the assumption that characters must advance in power. They then grab
the first obvious mechanism for accomplishing this that comes along – character
levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>As soon as this &quot;characters must advance&quot;
assumption gets baked into a design, however, the same results follow inexorably:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Levels are increased by gaining &quot;experience
     points.&quot;</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>XP is gained by performing specific tasks (quests,
     killing random mobs, etc.).</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Different tasks give different amounts of XP.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Some tasks give little XP, but are easy/safe.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Players repeat easy/safe tasks (i.e.,
     &quot;grind&quot;) to rise in level with little risk.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Grinding easy/safe tasks takes time and is boring.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>The overall result is that the first thing players get to
do in all of these games is to spend weeks or even months in mindless,
double-plus-unfun grinding before getting to the &quot;high-level game&quot;
that is (theoretically) where the really fun content becomes available. Players
don't have to do it this way, but they do because the design rewards it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Grinding is thus an inescapable consequence of having character
levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>So why have character levels?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>To begin with, let's admit something: a gamer who's determined
to grind will find a way to do it in pretty much any game. The fact that the
overwhelming majority of today's MMORPGs accept the character advancement
assumption means that it has become what the current crop of online gamers are
used to. Even so, why should designers shrug their shoulders and only make
games that cater to this mindset, thereby turning all future online gamers into
grinders as well?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>A common objection to dropping the &quot;characters must
advance&quot; assumption is that players absolutely must have some way of
becoming more powerful in the game world, and that without character levels,
players will simply replace grinding for XP with grinding for loot or in-game
currency. There's some merit to this objection. In RPGs without character
levels, character possessions become more important as one kind of marker of a
character's personal history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>My suggested response to this boils down to loot atoms
being &quot;bigger&quot; than XP atoms. Compared to XP-generating content, I
think it's a little easier to define ways to generate loot (including money)
that lead to less grinding because they occur less often. Since increasing in
power is what these games are about, it’s OK for the rewards that support that
goal to be medium-frequency rewards, rather than the very frequent little
rewards (usually XP) they are currently. But that's open to debate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Either way, that's a mechanistic response that begs the
question of why all MMORPGs should reward power-chasing. Why do we accept this
assumption that the most important attribute for distinguishing one character
from another is power? Why is power the only thing that should drive gameplay?
(Bear in mind that I'm using the word &quot;power&quot; here to mean both
direct power over other players/characters and resource security with respect
to other players/characters – the defining characteristics of the Killer-Motivator/Artisan
and the Achiever/Guardian respectively.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Certainly power – gaining it and holding it – is a strong
motivator for some people. It's fine that there are some games that reward it.
(It's also easier for designers to simply do another power-centric <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD">diku</a>-style game than to dream
up something new, and not a surprise that publishers are more willing to fund
games that are like what's been done before.) But having power over others
isn't the strongest motivator for everyone, and that includes people who play
online games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>So why limit your audience when you don't have to? If you
can create a game that Achievers can still enjoy but that is more welcoming to
other playstyles (because it’s about more than just character advancement),
then why not do that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>A final objection is from the customer-control perspective:
designs that require players to grind out character advancement levels offer
simple gameplay that keeps people playing. In other words, grinding for XP is a
deliberately built-in time sink intended to keep subscription money rolling in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>That might seem to make financial sense, but it's not
exactly a fun-centric approach to designing a game, is it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>On the other hand, there are counter-examples of
successful games without character advancement... at least, there are in the
tabletop RPG world. Probably the best example is Marc Miller's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)">Traveller</a>
RPG. Traveller (and its descendants since 1977) offered an extremely
full-featured character generation system, but once that was done you simply
played the game. There wasn't any levelling or grinding necessary; the game was
all &quot;high-end content.&quot; And yet Traveller was at one time the most
popular science-fiction RPG. (In fact, it's still popular -- June 2007 is the
scheduled release date for the newest incarnation, <a
href="http://www.farfuture.net/ffe/n5551.html">Traveller5</a>.) A lot of gamers
seemed very happy with an RPG that wasn't about character advancement at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Why wouldn’t an online RPG want a piece of that action?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>In my copious free time I've been developing a design
document for a MMORPG that doesn't force players to level up their characters before
getting to The Good Stuff. But I'm just a self-funded amateur with a day job.
Where is the pro developer willing to profit from the stated desire of so many
gamers to play an MMORPG with no grind?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
claim that dumping the assumption that character levels are necessary is a
perfect solution to grinding, or that it's &quot;the future of MMORPGs&quot; or
any such thing. I just wish someone would give it a serious AAA shot so that we
can see if it might work after all.</span></p>
