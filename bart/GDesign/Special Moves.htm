<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Why Special Moves Are
Wrong for MMORPG Combat</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/03/13</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Auto-attack
-- as in, click the button and your character starts swinging the old battleaxe
until either he or the target is toast -- doesn't bother me in a MMORPG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a
first-person shooter or a MMOFPS, in a game that was designed to be all about
combat, yes, just clicking to resolve combat would bug me. But in an RPG? Not
so much. I can handle that level of abstraction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. In a
role-playing game, we're already abstracting capabilities we (the players)
don't personally possess into an in-game character. We (the players) aren't
really bards or thieves; we probably don't actually know how to play a lute or
pick a lock; and we definitely don't live in a world where magic works. And
it's not likely that we're all master duellists, either.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So if
we're willing to accept the abstraction of magical abilities in a game (&quot;I
cast my Heal spell&quot;) as things our characters can do that we can't, why
not also accept the abstraction of combat as click-to-attack? In terms of
plausibility versus our real-world capabilities, one's about as good as the
other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. On the
other hand, making combat more complex than clicking an
&quot;attack-until-dead&quot; button doesn't bother me, either. I prefer
complex systems; they're more interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
said, however, I do object to building complexity into combat simply by
implementing special moves. Here's why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A. It's
not &quot;tactical.&quot; Tactics isn't just about spamming special attacks
faster than the other guy. Tactical superiority comes from having a better
perception of the features of the local environment (including your opponent's
capabilities), from planning that makes effective use of those environmental
features, and from being able to adapt quickly to changes in the environment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A game
that really wanted to offer fun combat would go there, rather than implementing
an artificial, Mortal Kombat-like &quot;special moves&quot; system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>B. When
games implement special combat moves, they send the message that what combat is
about is one-on-one dueling, rather than squad-level action. If dueling is the
conscious, deliberate choice of the game's developers, then OK, but if the
designers would prefer combat to be about group action, then implementing
special (individual) moves probably will not achieve that goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>C. Going
beyond auto-attack in combat can wind up getting very complicated very quickly
as developers have to exhaustively test all potential combinations of attacks
and defenses. (Otherwise some player is likely to find a &quot;win button&quot;
and ^poof^, there goes all the fun out of your combat gameplay.) This can
create systems that are hard to maintain and time-consuming to test.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>D.
Designing, implementing, enhancing and maintaining a particularly complex
system of special attack and defense moves reduces parity between combat and
non-combat gameplay. When a developer spends a lot of time on a complex combat
system, and as a result has little time available to spend on a similarly
complex crafting or economic or magic system, the game can become too
unbalanced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even
accepting that a game should have more combat than non-combat features (a
proposition I don't accept for a mass-market MMOG, but let that pass), the
examples of other MMOGs suggest that trying to keep a system of complex
attack/defense moves properly balanced winds up becoming a huge time sink. It
really does seem to prevent much useful time being spent on serious non-combat
content. Eventually that imbalance will drive away the non-combat players a
MMOG needs for maintaining long-lasting communities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>E. No
matter how much time you put into a system of special combat moves, there'll
always be some players howling that &quot;their&quot; class needs more love in
the form of special moves. It's a no-win situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>F.
Implementing combat as special moves is an invitation to players to use
supermacros and third-party hacks. Simple combat keeps the playing field more
level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
summary, I'd rather combat was about group action than one-on-one dueling; I'd
rather it was about environmental perception and exploitation than about
spamming special moves; and I'd rather it didn't come to dominate a MMOG that
was intended for a mass market.</span></p>
