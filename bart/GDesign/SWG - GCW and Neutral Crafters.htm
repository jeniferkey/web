<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I read
the same GCW notes, and I also wondered how crafters will fit into the new GCW
structure, but I have a different take on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Namely:
What incentives do the revised GCW rules offer crafters (and other
non-combatants) to participate in the GCW?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As far as
I can see, the answer is &quot;none.&quot; If anything, the new rules actually
make GCW participation more dangerous for crafters without providing any kind
of corresponding inducement to join up. Given that there were virtually no
reasons for crafters to participate under the original rules, how do the
proposed changes improve SWG for crafters at all? How do these changes increase
the &quot;Star Wars&quot; factor of SWG for crafters when non-combatants are
actually penalized for trying to get involved in the GCW?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
how do these changes make SWG more fun for non-combatants? Or does that matter?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm not
opposed to these changes. I actually like what I think will happen under the
new rules for fighters. I think the changes make a lot of sense for them. But
what about non-fighters? Do the developers want us to participate in the
Galactic Civil War or not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>From
these changes, the impression I get is &quot;not.&quot; Only those with combat
skills are wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Disappointing,
this is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
crafter in the middle of a war zone, I'm not expecting to be able to defend
myself with weapons. Not only do I completely get that, I agree that that's how
it should be. I don't have a problem with the new GCW rules as far as they go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My
concern is that the new rules don't go far enough. They offer new incentives
for combat players to participate in the GCW in this game, and that's a good
thing... but there doesn't appear to have been any thought whatsoever given to
how crafters could participate more in the GCW as well. I think there ought to
be something in the new rules to encourage crafters to play an active role in
the Rebellion or the Empire, and I'm disappointed that the only comment related
to crafters was basically a smackdown: &quot;crafters aren't worthy; if you're
factioned, you'll probably die -- too bad.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
crafter, I'm not asking for new features that allow me to smoke stormtroopers
or blow up Rebel bases -- I'm just looking for some sign that the developers
consider crafters a desirable part of the SWG game world by including them when
they offer new game features. If the new GCW rules included features allowing
crafters to make some useful contribution to shifting the balance of power in
the galaxy, that would tell me that SOE was serious about making SWG fun for
everyone, not just fighters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But I
don't see that in the new GCW rules. And that's disappointing, not just to me
personally as a crafter, but as a missed opportunity to bring new
crafting-oriented players into SWG so that it's more fun for everyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As to
specific ways that crafters could contribute to the GCW, there've already been
plenty of threads suggesting good ideas. Merchants could make financial
contributions; Armorsmiths/Weaponsmiths could craft factional items; Architects
could repair bases; Artisans could survey for or even supply harvested
materials to an NPC contact -- there are all kinds of ways crafters could be
allowed to contribute more (and these ideas are just the most trivial).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
specific idea isn't important (although it would help if whatever actually got
implemented were really fun). What's important is that SOE offer <i>something</i>
to crafters to indicate that we're wanted in this game, rather than completely
ignoring us when reworking one of the most Star Wars-specific aspects of the
entire game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So: this
isn't a rant against the fighters. It's a request to be offered the same level
of respect when new game features are created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A couple
of quick final points:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. If
factional armor craftable by players in included in the Combat Upgrade, I think
that's great. Here's hoping!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. On the
question of whether a crafter (let's say an Armorsmith) should have to be of
the &quot;correct&quot; faction to make that kind of armor, I wouldn't object
if factional armor crafting were implemented that way... but let's consider the
alternative.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What if a
Rebel could make stormtrooper armor? That seems odd, but why shouldn't it be
allowed -- as long as there are reasonable consequences for doing so?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Wouldn't
it be interesting to be able to create a story around something like this? All
interesting stories are about conflict... and wouldn't a factioned Rebel be
conflicted about doing something that helped the Empire?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe you
lose faction points for every point of damage done by your faction to that armor.
That's crude, but it shouldn't be too hard to implement and offers a direct
consequence for doing something &quot;against&quot; your faction. Support the
other side for too long, and you lose enough faction points to maybe get kicked
out of your faction entirely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>More
interestingly, what if crafting the other side's factional items started
causing increasingly negative reactions from NPCs of your faction? You could
remain a Rebel or Imperial, but your perks would start decreasing in value; you
begin to be stripped of your factional ranks; recruiters would start sneering
at you and accusing you of being a traitor; &quot;name&quot; NPCs might visit
you and demand that you stop helping the enemy -- you get the idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It seems
to me that as long as there are appropriate consequences, players ought to be
able to do what they want. It means &quot;odd&quot; things can happen, but it's
those odd things that allow interesting stories to be created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>
