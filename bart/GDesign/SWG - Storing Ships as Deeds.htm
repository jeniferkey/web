<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Since
when was convenience the most important aspect of a multiplayer game?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Of course
the game shouldn't require players to do something over and over that adds
nothing to the game. That's just grinding, and grinding isn't fun. But just
because the game doesn't make accessing some feature as easy as blinking
doesn't automatically make it a grind. If there's some rational justification
for slowing players down a little, then a bit of &quot;inconvenience&quot; is
not only acceptable, it's necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
said, I also don't think games need to be so complex in the name of
&quot;realism&quot; that only a NASA astronaut with a doctorate in aeronautical
engineering can play them. Realism is fine up until the point where you start
including features that force players to do tedious tasks that don't advance a
story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In this
case, on the one hand we have the game mechanism of storing an enormous
starship as ones and zeroes in a datapad (even though that ship probably took
tens of thousands of resources to build) because reusing the &quot;deed&quot;
interface meant more programming time available for space combat features. And
on the other hand (per niennumb's excellent idea) we have the more realistic
(both in physical and Star Wars terms) suggestion that our ship can only be in
space or docked at an orbital space station, which would require us to shuttle
up to a station to use our ship. It's not as realistic (again, either in
real-world or Star Wars terms) as having instanced landing bays near starports,
but it's still more realistic than stuffing a giant starship down your pants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Are we
really in that much of a hurry to be going-running-doing-killing that we're
willing to accept a completely unrealistic game mechanic?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm not a
SW continuity fanatic. If the developers of JtL add mass driver weapons -- even
though no such weapon was ever described in the movies -- I could accept it,
because it might be reasonably argued that such a weapon is a necessary feature
in a space combat game. But the idea of putting an entire ship in a datapad
goes too far. No such technology is ever even speculated about in SW; if it had
been, Luke would never have needed Yoda to drag his X-wing out of the muck on
Dagobah -- he'd have just called it up from his datapad when he got back to
Dagobah Starport and zoomed away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Time is
only of the essence in multiplayer games if you believe that they're merely
things to be beaten as quickly as possible. But what about the idea that these
games aren't merely short-term goals to reach, but long-term journeys to
experience? In which case, isn't experiencing the logic of the background story
more important than gameplaying convenience?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Put me
down for &quot;inconvenience&quot; on this one. The few minutes I spend
shuttling someplace to get my ship is totally justifiable as long as it creates
the feel of being in the Star Wars universe without being a major impediment to
gameplay. I think achieving that kind of balance between story realism and game
convenience ought to be what we expect from SWG's developers.</span></p>
