<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Instant Travel
Considered Harmful, Part 2</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/12</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
an interesting difference between a portal system and a summoning system.
Namely, in a portal system you can choose to zip to a place for any reason (or
no reason), while in a summoning system you're pulled to a place because you're
needed/wanted there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
this difference means that a portal system would result in people bypassing
terrain by default, while a summoning system would have people zipping past
terrain mostly to serve the specific group goal of a quest or raid. I think
this favors the summoning approach as that would produce less content
bypassing, but I'm open to disagreement on that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Both
portals and summonses have some interesting possibilities as transportation
systems. Assuming that you've designed the world properly and that there's some
reasonable world-story behind it, there's no reason why you couldn't assign the
teleporter function (in either &quot;push&quot; or &quot;pull&quot; mode) to
any in-world object.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So you
could set up a teleport pad beneath an obelisk in a city as a gate to another
place, letting it activate every ten minutes or so to send whoever's on the pad
at that time to some specific location in the world. (Pretty much standard
behavior.) Or you could assign the same function to a portable teleport pad
that you pull out of your inventory and drop on the ground. Such a pad might be
set to activate automatically when someone steps on it... and what if such pads
could be invisible? It ought to cost a mountain full of cash to keep such
things running, but it would be an interesting twist on minefields. *evil grin*</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
way to apply the teleport function might be as a kind of last-resort device.
Push the button (or however it's invoked), and any enemy within ten feet of you
gets transported to a random location (not inside any object!) 100 feet away.
If you're getting ganged up on and need to make a quick getaway, such an object
could be quite valuable. (Do I even need to mention how insanely expensive
something like this should be to construct?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An
attachable teleport capability could work in pull-mode as well, albeit a little
differently. For example, you could set up a one-shot summons marker in your
home town plaza. When activated either on some condition (low on health/mana)
or by a device (&quot;Beam me up, Scotty!&quot;), you're pulled to that
location. Another possibility would be to put summonses on several small
objects which could be given to friends, and key them to a master device.
Activate the master device, and no matter where they are, whoever's got one of
the small objects gets pulled to the location of the master device. Great for
pulling groups together very quickly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You get
the idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
the issue of griefing should be mentioned. (I didn't earlier, but this might be
a good time.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Blocking
other people from accessing things, and doing things to other people without
their consent (even if that consent is only implicit), tend to be considered
griefing and will really, really irritate players. If a portal system can be
blocked, that might make IC sense and even contribute to interesting gameplay,
but it's still going to make some people very unhappy. They're not going to
care that defense of a transportation node is realistic; they're just going to
be upset that they can't go where they want when they want. A &quot;summons
block&quot; (like the &quot;teleport block&quot; in Steven Brust's great
&quot;Jhereg&quot; novels) will have the same effect -- it might be a very cool
ability, but it's really going to tick off some players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
means a couple of things. First, it brings up the question of whether objects
should be collidable. If the HJ developers haven't started dealing with this
yet, eventually they're going to have to... and when they do, they'll find it's
a huge headache.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Among the
flags that need to exist for every object are these:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Can the
     object exist in the world on its own (outside a player's inventory)?</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Can the
     object be placed by a player, or picked up and moved by a player?</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is the
     object collidable to any degree?</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If the
answer to all three of these questions is yes, you may have a &quot;blocked
access griefing&quot; problem. But if the answer to any of these questions is
no, you may have other problems!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Not
letting any objects exist in the world that can at some time have been in a
player's inventory makes the world feel insubstantial. If you can't leave some
mark on the world, how is anyone to know you've ever existed? As for
collidability, it just feels strange to walk or fly through some large,
substantial-looking object.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
second issue is the question of consent. If you allow players to do things to
other players without their consent (like teleport them), you're absolutely
going to hear howls of outrage. &quot;I was right in the middle of [X]!&quot;
But if you require consent for teleports, you not only lose a number of
opportunities for fun gameplay mechanics, you have to build a consent GUI
(&quot;Do you agree to [Y]?&quot; And when you do that, you risk enabling
&quot;pester griefing&quot; as someone repeatedly causes a consent GUI to pop
up on your display.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I tell
you, the code for MMOGs would probably be about half its usual size and take
half as long to create if developers didn't have to hammer out special logic to
prevent the many forms of griefing. Sigh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Developing
a MMOG is definitely not all fun and games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>
