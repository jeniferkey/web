<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/16</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I got
interested in systems design something like 25 years ago, and I continue to be
fascinated by it. (It's fun to discover similarities in apparently dissimilar
things.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In all
this time of looking at things as systems, and seeing some basic principles
that seem to apply to almost every system, there's one in particular I find
especially fascinating. It's that systems, when they're delivered, tend to
create constituencies that, because they benefit from that system, don't want
it to change. Unless the system's controller is able to fight this effect,
eventually that system will cease to do what it originally did because its
priority has shifted to self-preservation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This effect
shows up in a lot of places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Any
programmer can tell you what happens when you finally ship a product. If it's
good enough that people want to use it, those users become a constituency. They
become proprietary about certain parts of the program and won't let you change
those parts in any meaningful way, even if you can clearly demonstrate that
some significant change would actually make the product more useful for them.
At this point, the only way you'll be able to make the major changes will be to
replace the program entirely. In a way, because the old program could not
adapt, it had to die to make room for the new one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. I
stopped worrying about monopolies when I realized that they're a great example
of this effect. When you get so big that you have no competition, you stop
growing. You cease to adapt... and then technology changes, and some upstart
company sells people what they really want while you're still trying to sell
them what you happen to be able to make. Basing your product development plans
on who's king of the mountain today is not a strategy for success when today's
mountain can become tomorrow's molehill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3.
Government is another great place to find this systems-effect. Agencies are
brought into being to solve a problem. If they do so to any degree at all (or
if their PR is good enough), they develop constituencies, not just of the
members of the public who are served but of the civil servants, bureaucrats and
other apparatchiks who staff that agency. Once this happens, the agency's focus
inevitably begins to shift from performing its stated function to preserving
its current form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. James
Grier Miller's <i>Living Systems</i> theory (see the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_systems_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_systems_theory</a>
entry at Wikipedia) describes the multiple functionalities an organism must
have to be considered &quot;living.&quot; By his definitions, not only can
individuals be said to live if they have certain functions, such as decider,
encoders and timers, but group organisms from city councils can be considered
to be alive. Accordingly, these systems also demonstrate the ability to adapt
to changing environments, and the need to continuously adapt in order to
survive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>5. The
most powerful exploration I've seen of this tendency toward self-preservation
over problem-solving can be found in Carroll Quigley's <i>The Evolution of
Civilizations</i>. (See the <a
href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Carroll_Quigley">http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Carroll_Quigley</a>
entry at the Center for Media and Democracy.) Quigley observes this same effect
operating on civilizations. As he put it, civilizations come into being when a
producing society develops an instrument of expansion. However, the forces that
enable this to happen because they benefit from it eventually divert more
resources to themselves than to the civilization. Quigley called this process
&quot;institutionalization&quot; of instruments of expansion, and presented
evidence that when it happens, a civilization has exactly three choices: it can
reform the institution back into an instrument of expansion; it can circumvent
the old institution (which now cares only for its privileges) with a new
instrument of expansion; or it can proceed to becoming a Universal Empire
which, after it consumes its reserves in a final Golden Age, falls apart and is
absorbed by a neighboring civilization that has an instrument of expansion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What's
the point of all this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's that
chasing established constituencies is usually a dead end. Even when you do wind
up being the successful copier -- the so-called &quot;second-mover
advantage&quot; (see <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-mover_advantage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-mover_advantage</a>
at Wikipedia) -- what you get for your effort is a fading constituency. The
consumer can ignore your offering, thinking &quot;Everybody knows that
so-and-so already did X right, and I've already got X from them, so why should
I get it again from you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I
modestly propose a couple of suggestions:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. For
MMOG developers, stop chasing WoW. After a market or genre is done right by a
successful second-mover, there's little point in copying them unless you're
satisfied with leftovers. Instead, be like Microsoft, who, after failing to
copy Novell's highly successful NetWare for local area networks, looked into
the near future to see what would be likely to be the next technology
controlling access to information and discovered this thing called an
&quot;Internet.&quot; Result: Novell tried to preserve itself intact by
catering to its LAN constituency, but became a footnote in history when that
constituency was circumvented out from underneath it by someone offering a
clearly more powerful new technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. The
same lesson applies to computer game development generally. Instead of looking
for what's popular today (existing genres) and refining it to its ultimate
form, circumvent constituencies by a) looking for gameplay capabilities that
are likely to be available in the near-term future, and b) building a game that
will be ready to exploit those new capabilities when they hit sufficient
penetration among consumers. Maybe that game will be a blend of two old genres.
(Who's up for a turn-based strategic simulation game besides me?) Maybe it'll
be the first game in a new genre we haven't even imagined because the
technology to support it wasn't yet imaginable. Either way, as soon as you've
done it, everyone will say it was obvious. ;-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>No, this
approach won't guarantee success. &quot;New&quot; doesn't imply
&quot;good.&quot; But given that copying the most popular games in a well-mined
genre is no guarantor of success, either, why not try the more revolutionary
alternative?</span></p>
