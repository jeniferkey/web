<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/16</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I am an

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some of
you may be familiar with a famous essay by Richard Bartle, one of the two
creators of MUD1, the earliest successful multiplayer computer RPG. After
watching players for some time, Richard perceived four common styles of
playing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>He
documented these types in his essay, <a
href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades:
Players Who Suit MUDs</a>. Bearing in mind that today's graphical MMOGs are
basically souped-up MUDs, his conclusions are still required reading for anyone
who likes thinking and talking about multiplayer game design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I won't
go into all the details; those of you who haven't read Richard's essay should
absolutely go read it right now. (Go ahead. I'll wait here for you.) (Now that
you're back, I should mention that since his essay, he has further developed
his four-type scheme into a system of eight playstyles. You can learn more
about this -- and many other things that are absolutely crucial to multiplayer
game design -- in his wonderful book, Designing Virtual Worlds. If you're at
all interested in this kind of thing, you will not find a better guide to
what's really required. It's that good.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Of the
four player types that Richard Bartle proposed -- Killers, Socializers,
Achievers, and Explorers -- I'd like to say two words about those last two
types: Achievers, because so many games these days are strongly oriented to
that playstyle, and Explorers, because so many games these days aren't... but
should be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
What follows is my own interpretation of Richard Bartle's concepts. I'm not
trying to relay his beliefs, so please don't criticize him for anything I say
here.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here are
what distinguish the Achiever and Explorer types:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Achievers
     are motivated by a desire for security, and seek it through collectibles:
     loot, money, status, fame, loot, guild membership, leader boards, loot,
     badges, ranks, and loot.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:3.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorers
     are motivated by a desire to know and understand, and seek these through
     experimentation: building, observing, analyzing, hypothesizing, mapping,
     boundary-testing, and structural decomposition and reconstruction.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
some important things to observe about these two playstyles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Different playstyles need different in-game rewards.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Notice
how the goals of Achievers are often concrete -- loot, badges, kill stats --
while the goals of Explorers are more abstract. Explorers seek knowledge of
structure, theories, cause-and-effect relationships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
distinction matters when we're talking about game design because it's a lot
easier to imagine how to code a tangible thing than an intangible thing.
Programming a leader board, for example, is fairly straightforward. (Though
offering one in-game in an in-context way may not be.) Ditto for loot, and for
money, and for badges. But how do you program a game reward for something like &quot;boundary-testing&quot;?
What does a reward for &quot;structural decomposition&quot; look like?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
result, MMOG developers produce more game features for Achievers than for
Explorers. This is not a successful long-term strategy... but more on that in
item #4. For now, suffice to say that Explorers just aren't going to be
motivated by Achiever rewards, any more than Achievers would value Explorer
rewards. Take public recognition as an example. While Explorers don't mind
getting recognition for the quantity of knowledge they've collected, it's not a
major motivator (and it can actually hurt Explorers by attracting
recognition-seeking Achievers). The typical Explorer is, on the other hand,
very interested in earning the respect of their fellow players for the quality
of their knowledge and the competence with which they collect it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This can
be a difficult kind of reward to offer in a game where once anyone knows
something, the whole world knows it because someone (or something like
thottbot) stuffed it onto a Web page. This is why the &quot;personal
recipe&quot; idea -- the notion that each player requires a near-unique list of
items to craft a particular object -- has become popular. It increases the
quality of information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although
I think this kind of mechanic may be a step in the right direction, I'm not
completely sold on it. My preference would actually be for a world where
&quot;knowing how&quot; is the province of only a few particular kinds of
players who personally enjoy having technical skills and using them
effectively. If you don't pick up those skills, you won't be nearly as
effective at technical tasks as someone who did choose to earn those technical
abilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Mathematics
is a great example of this. Suppose someone gives you an enormous ballista. By
the time you got done figuring out through trial and error how to aim it to hit
a target, your target would have pincushioned you with flaming arrows. But now
suppose you can hire a mathematician, who after one firing can calculate
exactly where you should aim to hit your target. You don't understand the math,
and frankly you don't care to... but you sure can appreciate someone who did
choose to master that technical skill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
someone would likely be an Explorer, who would probably get a huge kick out of
a game that actually rewarded them for picking up a &quot;geek&quot; skill...
as long as there are other uses for that skill beyond just whatever helps an
Achiever. Nobody wants to play a hammer -- nobody wants to have value only so
long as they're a good tool for someone else to use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let
Explorers have specialty skills that enhance the gameplay of others and that
promote the discovery of even more arcane knowledge. Find ways to reward them
for the quality of their knowledge and their skill at acquiring the most
difficult knowledge. Let them achieve a reputation for learning and wisdom that
has value far beyond merely acquiring loot. You'll wind up with a game whose
players help each other have their own style of fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And that
will be a Good Thing for everybody.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
Exploration is about mapping terrain, but is not just about geography.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Certainly
physical exploration of places is the most obvious application of
&quot;exploration.&quot; But when I say that &quot;exploration is about mapping
terrain&quot; I'm not just talking about physical terrain (physical within the
virtual world, that is). To create a &quot;map&quot; of &quot;terrain&quot; is
to produce a more convenient but still useful representation of a thing that
has texture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sure, a
map could be of some place's topography. But we can also talk about mapping the
frequency with which players visit certain cities, or about maps of economic
activity, or even diagrams of crafting processes. All these things highlight
what Explorers do: they discover and chart the internal features of systems.
They uncover lore. (Explorers all think of themselves as Loremasters.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If a MMOG
implements &quot;exploration&quot; as game features allowing players to
discover and map unexplored places, OK, cool. No objection. But it seems to me
that a game that really wanted to reward Exploration would do more -- it would
include game systems that are designed from the very beginning to be both broad
and deep. That is, it would have numerous richly interacting systems
(&quot;broadness&quot;), and each of those systems would offer meaningful
complexity in itself arising from simple fundamental rules that interact with
each other (&quot;depth&quot;).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Once
they'd laid that framework, developers of an Explorer-friendly game would then
work hard to find many ways to reward players for discovering those
interactions. Not through badges or leader boards or big recognition; those are
Achiever rewards that tend only to encourage Achievers to act like Explorers
(to neither's benefit). As hard as it may be for a non-Explorer to understand
or believe, many Explorers value knowledge for its own sake. For them it's
enough that they can put together a map of the Shadowy Chasm of Certain Doom,
or figure out the secret code that reveals the location of Captain Greenbeard's
treasure, or discover which ingredients increase by 25% the efficacy of the
formula for making Potions of Clearmindedness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe
they'll share that knowledge, or sell it. Maybe they don't. Maybe they use that
knowledge. Maybe they don't. For the Explorer, it's just really cool to know
it. A game that wants to encourage Explorers to play will find ways to respect
that worldview through explicit gameplay and world features that reward it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3.
Crafting is not just about sales.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorers
tend to enjoy crafting in MMOGs that offer it. SWG attracted a lot of Explorers
initially by offering a remarkably full-features crafting system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But too
many people think that &quot;crafting&quot; means &quot;selling crafted
goods.&quot; Not so!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Many
(most?) MMOGs put the two things together out of expedience; it's just simpler
to let the people who make things sell those things. But these are two very
different kinds of game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Crafting
per se is about creation; it's about making, building, constructing, and about
trying new combinations to produce unexpected results. It's a non-zero-sum game
because you're adding to the total of wealth in the world by creating new
wealth -- your success doesn't depend on anyone else's failure. So the
creating/building part of crafting winds up being very attractive to many
Explorers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sales, on
the other hand, is a competitive game. A big part of the fun is measuring your
success against that of others. This means it tends to attract not Explorers,
but Achievers, since the latter are the folks who most enjoy collecting things
like money and seeing whose stack is biggest. A sales game can be a lot of fun
in a MMOG (EVE Online corp and market players know this well), but it's not for
everyone. And it's not inherently part of a crafting game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So my
request to developers is to recognize this distinction. Don't believe that you
can attract Explorers to your game by designing a crafting game that requires
sales. A sales game is good if it can be played by non-crafters, and a crafting
game is good if non-merchants find it rewarding in and of itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I have
some ideas on how to accomplish that, but it's possible that this post is
already getting a little long.... ;-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4.
Explorers help maintain strong communities.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Trying to
attract Explorers by offering game features that respect and reward their
interests is not merely about bumping up your subscription numbers with
Explorers... although I personally think that's a nice benefit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
massively multiplayer online game isn't a single-player game. At least as
important as your gameplay features (combat, crafting, sales, etc.) will be the
community of players that develops inside your game once you release it.
Otherwise, what's the point of being massively multiplayer? If your players
never need to interact with each other, you might as well save yourself the
trouble of writing client/server code and just ship a single-player game with
really clever bots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Assuming
you still want to produce a MMOG, it's not good enough to cater solely to
Achievers. Achievers tend to become bored quickly -- like locusts, they swarm
to a new game, burn through anything resembling &quot;content,&quot; then zoom
off again to consume the Next Big Game. (Note that I'm not anti-Achiever.
Achievers, in proper measure, are good for a multiplayer game; they add
tremendous energy. Their approach to gameplay doesn't make them &quot;bad&quot;
or &quot;wrong,&quot; it's just the expression of their motivations. They
expect to be actively and continuously entertained by your product's gameplay
features; once that's no longer true, they'll leave. It's that simple.)</span></p>

want to promote a long-lasting community in your game, if in short you want
your game world to function and feel like a world , then you need Explorers.
You need to explicitly design your game to attract and retain Explorers -- and
Socializers, too -- because these are the kinds of players who treat the game
world as a world. They form long-lasting attachments to a world, and to the
other players in that world, and just by doing the kinds of things they enjoy,
they perform the critical world-maintaining functions that benefit every player
in that world.</span></p>
