<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Maybe it's just me, but I find the standard pattern of
gaining XP by making an object, and then using that XP to gain a skill level in
making objects, lethally boring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>The only thing this conception of &quot;crafting&quot; can
possibly lead to is grinding. Crafting becomes dominated by Achievers who are
willing to grind a zillion worthless objects in order to gain the title of
&quot;Master Whatever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Blecch. As an Explorer, why should I pay to play a game
like that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>I think the problem with this &quot;XP from making
stuff&quot; paradigm in RPGs is that it shifts the learning process to the
character... but it's the <i>player</i> for whom learning is fun! When the
crafting game is designed so that it's the character who &quot;learns&quot;
(i.e., gains a skill level by making stuff), that form of entertainment is
taken away from the Explorer players who would enjoy it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Role-Playing Games allow you-as-a-character to do things
that you-as-a-real-person can't do. So it makes sense to design an RPG to allow
characters to have increasible skills in things like Broadsword and Fireball
and so on. But it's a mistake to apply that approach blindly to everything --
if it's something that players can reasonably be expected to do (and enjoy
doing), and it's OK in the context of the game for them to do it, then it
shouldn't be abstracted as a character skill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Crafting as a form of discovery is, I think, one of those
things that players can and should do themselves. It's the player's ability to
understand complex systems that should determine the character's effectiveness
in the game -- a grindable system for mimicking this ability only takes fun out
of the game for these players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Accordingly, crafting as I'd like to see it designed into
a game (not necessarily every game, but <i>some</i> game somewhere) would do
two things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>First, it would recognize that different kinds of players
have different reasons for wanting to make things -- in particular, that there
are &quot;discovery crafters&quot; and &quot;sales crafters.&quot; And it would
therefore offer two separate but related crafting disciplines: Research and
Manufacturing. (The actual discipline names would be picked to reflect the
period and genre.) Research would be about letting Explorers learn how to make
new things; Manufacturing would enable Achievers to mass-produce items to
compete in the sales game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Second, the Research game would shift discovery-based
learning away from the character and over to the player. The fun would be in
letting the player figure out the rules of the system through thoughtful
experimentation. (No, of course other players wouldn't consider this fun, but
they've already got plenty of content focused on their entertainment style.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Gameplay would involve using knowledge about the
properties and behaviors of materials to collect more such knowledge. Players
would devise tests for the player's Researcher character to run that apply
selected materials to each other in new ways to see what happens. (In other
words, players would attempt to discover processes by which the properties or
forms of materials can be changed.) The character would then do the scutwork of
running those tests (possibly with some +/- modification of the results based
on the character's &quot;skill&quot; level), and the player would be presented
with the results.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>If the results aren't sufficiently better than some
existing process (and they typically shouldn't be), enough information will be
returned so that the player can think of another test to try. This is the
&quot;learning from mistakes&quot; part of discovery-crafting. (Trying to
figure out how to let characters in an RPG learn from failures is unnecessary
and undesirable -- it's the player whose imagination is being challenged who
needs to be rewarded.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>If the results of an experiment clearly show that a better
way to do something has been identified, then the player has found a new
process. Once it's properly defined and documented, this new process can then
be made available (through patent licensing to any/all Manufacturing players or
outright sale to an individual Manufacturing player) in exchange for resources
(money, materials, labs, directorships, etc.) that allow for more advanced
experimentation. (Note: The details of this interface would have to be worked
out carefully to insure that Achievers aren't motivated to create Researcher
alts that would crowd out actual Explorer crafters.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>The virtue of this dual-path approach to designing
crafting is that it doesn't confuse what Explorers want with what Achievers want.
By separating Research from Manufacturing, Achievers retain the
crafting-as-sales game that they're accustomed to and expect while Explorers
finally get a discovery-centric game feature that's worth the money they pay in
subscription fees. And by carefully designing these two kinds of crafting to
work together to produce desirable goods, all the other players of the game
benefit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>In summary, crafting should be about more than just the
mass production of identical items. It can and should also reward the
distinctive creativity of individual players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>I'd really like to play <i>that</i> game.</span></p>
