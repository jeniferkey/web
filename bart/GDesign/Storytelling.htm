<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One area
of MMORPGs that is currently rich with opportunity for designers is quest
design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A problem
I've had with quest design lately is that individual quests (missions, whatever
you want to call them) seem to be created in a vacuum. They may come from
characters in the game world, and they may tell a little story, but ultimately
they're just self-contained pellet dispensers -- pull the lever, do what you're
told, get a reward pellet. Lather, rinse, repeat. Yawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In other
words, I see quests being used almost exclusively as a time sink. They're just
quickie content tossed into the game to give the player something to do, or to
provide a reward pellet. Wouldn't quests would be a lot more fun if they
offered &quot;gameplay&quot; beyond just another collectible reward for
Achievers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
two suggestions I'd like to offer for achieving this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Quests
should relate to each other to tell parts of higher-scale stories, and should
all be part of a few stories with epic sweep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
developers need to set the fundamental story rules by thinking about the past,
present, and future history of the game world. Then all existing content should
be keyed to telling some part of the unfolding story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Instead
of quest content being disconnected (because it's viewed as nothing more than a
way to supply reward pellets), NPC-directed player activities ought to be
integrated into a set of overarching stories, which themselves are integrated
into a few epic-level sagas, each of which contributes toward letting players
reveal the future history of the game world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's OK
if early/easy quests <i>seem</i> to be unconnected. New players should see only
the most local effects of their actions in order not to overwhelm them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But as
players advance in power, they should begin to realize that what appeared to be
unconnected requests were really individual parts of something much larger
going on, and that participating in these quests makes the player a part of the
larger story. Quests to kill off bandits in a particular area could turn out to
be preliminary action for establishing a secret enemy base secure from prying
eyes, and a player who realizes this should be encouraged to wonder whether his
character would support that storyline or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These
realizations that players have about the local meaning of what they've been
doing should eventually begin to open up larger-scale quests -- let's call them
adventures. Adventures should be riskier than than the initial quests, and
should require the player to make more intense choices -- do you help those who
need it even when it could injure you or your friends? Or do you put your
personal desires above everything, even if it means abandoning the larger
effort to the &quot;bad guys?&quot; The more adventures you take, the more you
learn about the grand storyline in which those adventures are related, and the
more you learn, the better your odds putting the pieces together to succeed at
those adventures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These
quests, if successful, should lead to the third and highest level of mission,
the saga, which would be a major story set within the mythos of the game.
Taking on a saga means you have entered the part of the story that reveals the
global challenge behind all the local stories. Succeeding in a saga should not
be about what gear a player has -- it should depend on his or her choices when
confronted by hard decisions. Success, in fact, should not necessarily mean
living or dying -- maybe it's about realizing who your character really is. As
in all great literature, the outer struggle should mirror the inner journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Integrating
quests like this would help players feel that they're not just grinding (even
if you still give them rewards for completing quests), but that what they do is
part of the big picture, that they're helping to reveal the game world's
reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
integrated storytelling through quests/adventures/sagas helps players feel that
what they do <i>means</i> something within the game world, even if they don’t
bear on the main storyline. I've yet to hear any players say they don't want
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
Players should be given tools that allow them to tell their own game
world-relevant stories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm not
looking for developers to do everything for me -- online games are an active
entertainment medium, not a passive medium like TV. Accordingly, MMORPGs should
require active player participation in the storytelling process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So in
addition to developer-created quests, the game should be designed to allow
players to use developer-created tools for creating their own multi-player
stories within this greater storyline. It would take some thought to minimize
abuse, but letting players place, minimally control, and script dialog for NPCs
would be an enormous asset in allowing players to help tell stories in the
online game world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Online
games are currently the only mass entertainment medium that is capable of
achieving this kind of mass collaborative storytelling. Wouldn't it be
interesting to see that potential realized in a MMORPG?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
conclude by noting that I'm not proposing all this stuff just to have
&quot;good storytelling.&quot; Dramatic expression is nice, but gameplay
matters, too. (And probably matters more.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm
suggesting these features because I believe that offering emotionally engaging
gameplay through collaborative storytelling can make a MMOG more viable
financially. A player who suddenly comes to understand the role she is playing
in a larger world has the chance to become more connected to that world... and
connectedness helps retain paying customers.</span></p>
