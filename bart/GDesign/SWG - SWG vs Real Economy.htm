<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2004/08/09</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Before we
start making value judgments (&quot;better&quot; vs. &quot;worse&quot;), it
seems to me we ought to have a better idea what the <i>differences</i> are
between SWG's economy and the US economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First of
all, though, we need to consider an objection: SWG's economy is virtual, while
the US economy is real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some very
smart people disagree, arguing that the economies of virtual worlds like SWG
are in fact quite real. In the first place (they argue), even inside SWG you've
got people trading money and goods and services. They're assigning values to
in-game objects and to their time, and making exchanges based on those
valuations... which means that what goes on in SWG is a real economy that just
happens to trade in virtual items. Even though the economic activity takes
place inside a virtual world, the activity itself is real... so the economy is
real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The other
response to the &quot;it's not really real&quot; objection is that since
in-game SWG property (characters, objects, credits) can be sold for real money
externally to the game, at real and quantifiable exchange rates (e.g. 100 SWG
credits per 0.01 US dollar), these things are in fact &quot;real
property,&quot; making in-game economic activity perfectly real.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So for
the purposes of this discussion, let's assume these folks are correct, and that
it's not utterly ridiculous to compare a real economy to one that only exists
on a few servers. What are the differences?</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An
Astromech Stats article illuminates how money is created and destroyed in SWG. The
term &quot;faucet-drain economy&quot; is used to explain how money enters and
exits the system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Interestingly,
this isn't terribly different from how the US economy works. When the
developers set the rough amount of a particular mission payout, they're in
essence letting players &quot;print money.&quot; Watching the amount of money
that gets created in SWG and tweaking the typical mission payout accordingly is
not radically different from calculating M1, M2, and M3 based on the financial
instruments actually in use and directing the responsible agency to print
either more or less money within the next fiscal period, based on how the money
supply is believed to affect key economic indicators (inflation and
unemployment rates being the two biggies).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If we
like, we can think of mission payouts being set by the Emperor's Exchequer.
This isn't the direct control of the money supply that developed capitalistic
nations use, but it's similar to a very socialistic system in which the
government gives money directly to workers in return for performing certain
tasks. (FDR's invention of the WPA, CCC, and other federal work-relief agencies
to stimulate the US economy during the Great Depression is a good real-world
example of this kind of economic system. Whether &quot;FDR = Evil Emperor&quot;
is a question I leave to others.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:white'>2. SWG has no central authority capable of taxing, borrowing,
lending, and spending.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although
we might think of mission payouts as coming from the Empire, the Empire doesn't
make those payments from an internal treasury whose contents come from taxation
(or some other form of wealth appropriation).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a real
economy, the central government actually holds the money that it takes from
workers (and from other sources such as tariffs) and redistributes that money
through various projects ranging from the broadly applicable, massive and necessary
(national defense) to the focused, small and trivial (a $20,000 grant to a
private institution). In SWG, money appears from out of thin air, then goes
nowhere when fees are deducted from specific in-game activities and economic
transactions (maintenance fees, travel fees, etc.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The main
difference here is that there's no one person or agency in SWG setting economic
goals that affect all players. In SWG, you're pretty much the master of your
own economic fate -- whatever money you want, you can make it without
&quot;government&quot; interference or even influence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. SWG
has no central institutions to set lending rates and guarantee deposits.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If a
government agency sets the goals, a central bank is what determines the
specific actions intended to achieve those goals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The US has the Federal Reserve Bank to set the prime lending rate, which is then used by other
lending banks for setting their own interest rates... but SWG has no lending
banks. Consequently there's no (relatively) easy way in SWG to obtain large
amounts of capital as in the real world. That wonder of modern finance, the
fractional reserve banking system, is unnecessary in SWG because banks don't
hold player savings and make loans from a percentage of those savings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. SWG
does not allow the creation of new intellectual property.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The only
things you can create in SWG are those things the developers have explicitly
built into the game. That's not a knock on SOE; this is just how things are.
SOE has chosen a business approach that assigns real-world property rights
(including the rights to this very message on SOE's official forum) to anything
&quot;created&quot; by users of SOE systems (such as SWG). As a result, you
can't make money in SWG by coming up with new content or a new idea (as you can
in the real world).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The MMOG
&quot;Second Life&quot; by Linden Labs, by comparison, explicitly asserts that
players who create new in-game content (by using SL's script language to
program new objects) actually own the real-world rights to that content. This
is much closer to the way that developed nations legally protect a creator's
copyrights and patents, and thus promote the creation of new forms of
intellectual property.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It will
be interesting to see if SL prospers economically as a result, where the SWG
economy languishes because it offers no similar incentive to in-game
innovation. Sure a lot of money gets made in SWG... but how much more could be
made if invention were supported and encouraged?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>5.
Money is easy to acquire in SWG.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The main
reason why we don't have or need S&amp;Ls in SWG is because money is so
ludicrously easy to obtain. Run a few missions, harvest a few desirable
resources, and you've got the seed money you need to go up the appropriate skilltree
to take even more lucrative missions or harvest even more resources. This
dramatically reduces the degree to which participants in an economic system
have to depend on and work with each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
probably necessary in a MMOG, where most people want to play their game on
their schedule without needing anyone else's support. But it does cut down on
any reason to create the group institutions (corporations, banks, governments)
that we develop in the real world to support and promote advanced economic
activity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>6. SWG
does not support organized labor.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By
&quot;organized labor&quot; I don't mean unions -- I mean that all crafting in
SWG can be done by one person. There are a very few items that as a practical
matter wind up being &quot;crafted&quot; by two people: one fighter to get the
schematic and any special components as loot drops, and one crafter to actually
build the item. But by far most items in SWG can be built by a lone individual
with the appropriate skills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By
contrast any advanced economy depends on organizing the labor of specialists.
You can build hugely complex systems (such as the manned lunar landings of the
Apollo program) if you properly organize the efforts of thousands of
individuals with specialized skills. SWG's rules are &quot;unrealistic&quot; in
that individuals can create certain complex objects that would (in the real
world) require coordinating the work of many people. Despite this there are
still many, many possible kinds of things that can't be crafted in SWG because
there are no structural rules in place that allow players to organize
themselves into business institutions (such as the corporation or limited
liability partnership).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>7. SWG
does not support player contracts.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
Real World, you and I can sign a contract that says you will give me X if I
give you Y, and the legal system under which that contract is signed will
support and require that both of us uphold our side of that contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
than the Secure Trade Window, SWG has no such &quot;general contract&quot; feature.
You and I might agree on some long-term deal, but because there's no in-game
system that requires compliance with economic agreements, there's nothing to
stop either one of us from hosing the other. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Consequently
a huge amount of economic activity that might take place in SWG never happens,
because players have no reason to trust that other players will hold up their
end of any bargain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A Player
Contract system with automatic enforcement of terms would allow SWG players to
trust each other (because they trust the system to uphold their rights under
&quot;contract law&quot;) enough to open up more in-game economic activity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(For more
-- much, much more -- on this subject, please see my essay <a
