Responsibility</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/12/07</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I like
the idea of sandbox games. I prefer games that give me the freedom to explore.
But I’m not the only one who plays these games, which means there's a social point
to be made concerning freedom: for it to work in any social system, freedom
must be balanced against responsibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One thing
that is crystal-clear about online games is this: freedom will be abused. If
you design a game so that players receive an in-game reward for some in-game
action (the usual Achiever-oriented design), there will be players who will do
anything they can -- up to and including client-side hacks -- to perform those
actions as rapidly and as continuously as possible in order to obtain an
advantage over other players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So we
need to be very careful how we implement &quot;freedoms&quot; in an online/persistent-world
game. Player A may enjoy some freedom responsibly, but Player B may take that
freedom as license to disrupt the game for other players (including Player A).
And you can't design a game assuming that the only people who'll ever play it
will be just like Player A. It can't be all about freedom; any functional
social system has to be survivable against the Player Bs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
other hand, it can't be just rules without freedom, either, where there is no
possibility for unique or novel behavior. In a game world, that's just Progress
Quest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Thus, I
think a maximally inviting mass-market MMOG has to be designed from the ground
up to balance freedom and responsibility. Offering freedom for free means it
will not be valued. That holds true in both the real world and virtual worlds
because we're talking about how human beings organize themselves socially. But
it can't be all responsibility, either; you need some inducements for positive
social behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So, like
the real world, the freedom to do stuff in an online, massively multiplayer
game should be made directly proportional to a player's demonstrated
willingness and ability to behave responsibly in the game world. Proven good
citizens get more power -- it's that simple.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well,
simple in concept, anyway. Execution is always trickier. But &quot;it's
hard&quot; is no excuse not to do something that's worth doing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
concrete example of what I'm talking about here, I've had a feature like this
in my MMORPG design for over a year now. Although my game is mostly skill-based,
rather than class-based, I do offer some professions, some of which have ranks.
In my game, however, you don't just get to advance in rank because you've
collected 8000 zorkmids or whatever -- advancement is built on service to other
players. In short, your power in the game is directly proportional to the
effort you put into helping other players have fun in the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Freedom
and responsibility. One without the other is no fun. And I believe game
designers who want to maximize fun in these social spaces ought to consciously
design their games so that freedom and responsibility are in balance with each
other.</span></p>
