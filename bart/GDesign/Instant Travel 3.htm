<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Reasonably
fast mounts aren't a problem, but teleporting is. Mounts and vehicles -- if
implemented carefully -- add to a world by giving players interesting choices
to make.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Both
super-fast vehicles and teleporting fail that test because they take the
&quot;interesting&quot; out of &quot;interesting choices.&quot; When a feature
is all plusses and no disadvantages (and costing a lot never remains a
disadvantage for long after the game launches), there are no choices to make!
When there's an obvious &quot;best,&quot; everyone who can will always take the
best. El yawno.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Mounts
and vehicles need disadvantages to balance their advantages. I don't mean
gimping them in some obvious way just to quickly solve a gameplay problem; I
mean limiting their utility in appropriate game situations so that there's
rarely a &quot;best&quot; solution in all cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, let's say there are four main modes of travel: walking, mounts,
vehicles, and ships. Walking can take you anywhere on land, but it's slow.
Mounts can move you on land faster than walking, but can't negotiate steep
terrain. Vehicles can go very fast on land (and some might be able to go slowly
on water), but can only travel quickly over roads; in other terrain, they're
not much faster than walking (but they can carry more stuff than a person). And
ships can go relatively quickly over water, and can carry big loads of stuff,
but can't go over land and are subject to being blown off course (this last
might be optional).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
creates a system in which not everyone is traveling in exactly the same way
because some travel options work better than others in different situations.
People get to make interesting choices based on their goals.</span></p>
