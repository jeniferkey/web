<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What this
means is that the capability of players to perform at a particular level will
be determined by the breadth and depth of in-game features that support the
enabling characteristic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, the range of tactical options available to your players will depend on
how completely the environment is modeled. If all you offer is line of sight,
then &quot;tactics&quot; will amount to two guys running up and hammering on
each other as fast as possible until one of them falls over. The more that
players are able to interact with their environment -- the more gameplay-relevant
features the environment has -- the more tactical options will become
available.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
I've mentioned elsewhere that I once worked out a fairly complete outline of
environmental features that would support stealth gameplay in MMOGs. In fact,
as environmental features what they really support is tactical gameplay. At
this point I might not mind posting the outline here -- assuming anyone's
interested -- except that it uses indented bullet points and this forum doesn't
seem to support that presentation style. Hmmm.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Likewise,
satisfying operational gameplay depends on players having in-game features
allowing them to create and fill organizational structures. (The system I
describe for allowing players to design their own organizations in MMOGs is
intended in part to support this goal.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And fun
strategic gameplay depends on integrating logistical action and high-level
organizational control -- in other words, on being able to move significant
quantities of specific resources to where they're needed. &quot;Resources&quot;
could include not just people, the greatest resource of all, but the food
products Seth mentioned as well as transportation systems (and their
requirements), housing if necessary, repair/maintenance services, and so on,
and all in big quantities. That's a very different kind of challenge than
tactical action, and it requires a different kind of thinking that isn't often
called for in MMOGs... which seems like a shame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It seems
to me that the only reason there aren't many games that offer all these
features is time. Doing a good job on one level means less time available to
focus on another level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
not always a bad thing. Take Advanced Squad Leader, for example, which is still
the gold standard of tabletop tactical-level simulations. ASL was detailed --
hoo, boy, was it detailed -- to the point that you wouldn't want to have to
also deal with higher-level needs. You'd go nuts!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
having said that, I don't believe it's necessary to go all the way to
&quot;simulation&quot; to get a lot of the fun out of the three levels of
engagement. The trick -- and it's not an easy one, I'll admit -- is to find the
right balance point among the three levels for the environmental,
organizational, and logistical features that you offer players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then
test that whole system like crazy!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. When
we talk about tactics and operations and strategy we typically assume the
subject is military action, but that's not necessarily always the case. In
fact, these levels show up in any multi-person competitive engagement of an
appropriate scale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sports,
for example, is often described using military terminology as metaphors. So is
business. And that's because the range of possible actions in both of these
competitive fields is determined by the same enablers as in combat:
environment, organization, and logistics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This can
be applied to MMOGs. Tactics and operations and strategy don't automatically
imply combat -- they can also be enabled in other areas. In particular, I
believe they could be implemented to great effect in an economic subgame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Can
anyone imagine the analogs of &quot;environment,&quot;
&quot;organization,&quot; and &quot;logistics&quot; in an economic/business
context within a MMOG? What might an economic subgame look like that offered
detailed environments, organizations, and logistics?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. But
getting back to combat.... Seth's absolutely right; of all the questions
related to really implementing interesting tactics and operations and strategy
in a MMOG, one of the toughest is: How do you deal with failure in combat?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a
military context, failure = death. (&quot;War is hell.&quot;) In a MMOG, that
means character death; there has to be some meaningful risk worth the reward of
controlling something of value (like territory).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
players don't like permadeath. They really, really don't like permadeath. And
yet anything less is easily shrugged off as just another trip from the cloning
station or magical resurrection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
have an answer for this that would be both effective and easy to implement. I
wish I did. If anyone else would like to take a shot at what character failure
in combat should mean tactically, operationally, and strategically, I'd really
like to hear that line of thought.</span></p>
