<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the things a developer usually wants to do is allow players to show each other
information about themselves. One of the ways this can be done, particularly in
a game that promotes the collection of items or ranks, awards, or other status
markers, is a &quot;badge&quot; system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I. THE
FUNCTIONS OF BADGES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Before
getting into suggestions about how to implement badges, it's useful to consider
the functions they can serve in a MMOG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>record
     of achievement</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Badges
serve first and foremost to tell other players what you've accomplished. In one
sense, this is just &quot;bragging rights,&quot; but there doesn't have to be
anything juvenile about it. Accomplishing something difficult -- even if only
in a game -- is worthy of being recognized publicly in that game. A badge
system that does this well will be a popular game feature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>indicator
     of playstyle</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Badges
serve as a way for a player to concisely describe his or her playstyle. In an
online game, your identify (that is, your character's identity) isn't
communicated so much by what you look like as by what you do. Your actions tell
people who you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Badges
are a kind of shorthand for describing the actions you've taken, and more specifically
the kind of actions you like to take. If you have more Location badges than
anything else, other players can assume (probably correctly) that you're more
interested in travelling than in combat or mastering professions. Similarly, if
you have numerous badges for things like &quot;...has slain over 10,000
animals&quot; and &quot;...has participated in the destruction of
[whatever]&quot;, then it's probably safe to assume that this is someone who
prefers combat to travel or profession-mastering, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So a badge
system that offers a few specific categories of badges, each of which is
clearly related to a unique playstyle, will be effective at letting other
players know what you like to do in the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>mark of
     common interests</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Badges
serve as markers that allow players to recognize each other as belonging to a
particular group or having similar interests. In real life, gang colors are an
example of this function of badges -- the MMOG version of this could be
considered to be the visible title appended to your name when you join a player
organization. Another example would be to see someone besides yourself wearing
armor like yours -- this serves as a kind of recognition marker for people who
like combat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The badge
system itself could also be used to perform this function -- what if we could
search for nearby players who are actively displaying certain badges or badge
types?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>conversation
     starter</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Badges
serve to indicate not just similarities but also differences. If we see a player
displaying a badge we've never seen before, or a badge in an area that
interests us, we can use that information to interact with the other player
where we might not have done so otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>II.
WHO'S INTERESTED?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's a
sense in which collecting badges suggests one MMOG playing style in particular:
the Explorer. This isn't someone who's just interested in visiting different
places; an Explorer is someone who enjoys finding all the content a game has to
offer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorers
don't just collect Location badges -- they also collect combat badges and
profession mastery badges; they want to know how the game works; they want to
understand why the game system behaves the way it does.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
players want this knowledge specifically to gain power over other players, or
for security from other players. These folks aren't Explorers, exactly; they do
these things more as achievements. In fact, that's what the typical person who
enjoys this accomplishment-oriented playstyle is called: the Achiever. There's
nothing inherently wrong with being an Achiever -- you could even say that
these are exactly the people that a badge system in a game is intended for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
Explorers are worth encouraging in an online game, too. These are the people
who not only know all the interesting features of a game, they understand why
those features exist and how best to enjoy them. An Explorer can not only tell
you where to find that critter you've been wanting to bag, but can also tell
you the best tactics to use and even whether there are other creatures in the
area that you might also be interested in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It seems
to me that this type of gameplay ought to have some badges geared toward it as
well. Location badges are a good start, but how about some additional ways to
indicate that a character has collected lots of knowledge about the game world?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
For more on Achievers and Explorers, and on the other two major playstyles --
Killers and Socializers -- read Richard Bartle's &quot;<a
href="http://www.mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm">Players Who Suit MUDs</a>&quot;.
Then find out what kind of playstyle you prefer by taking the Bartle test at
Erwin Andreasen's &quot;<a href="http://www.andreasen.org/bartle/">Bartle
Quotient</a>&quot; site.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>III.
&quot;PHYSICAL&quot; DISPLAY</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Badges
shouldn't just be bit of text that you have to /examine someone to see -- they
ought to be &quot;physical&quot; objects in the game world that your character
can actually see being worn by another character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
various ways this could be done. One obvious way already in the game is high-level
armor, especially high-level factional armor. Another type of &quot;badge&quot;
is someone being followed by a creature pet -- the creature acts as a kind of
marker to tell other players that this person is probably a pet handler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But why
not make this type of badge official? Certain badges ought to be actual
physical objects (in the game) that a player can choose to display. The most
obvious form of this kind of badge is as something you wear outside your
clothing -- medals, pins, rank sashes, and other decorations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Or you
could let the player choose one badge from those she's won to be displayed as a
visual effect -- perhaps a glow, or an icon displayed above her head. This
wouldn't have to be fancy; a simple icon would be enough (although fancy would
be cool). And it could reuse the code recently added to allow some
&quot;emoticons&quot; to be displayed above a character's head, so it shouldn't
even be very technically challenging.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I say let's
think about what badges are really good for... and then go to town thinking of
ways to enhance the current badge system to achieve those goals!</span></p>
