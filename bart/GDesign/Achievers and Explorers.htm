<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Achiever Rewards and
Explorer Rewards</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/17</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The more
I think about MMOG design, the more importance I place on recognizing that
people have different playstyles. What's &quot;fun&quot; for one person is boring
to another. So games need to be designed with this in mind; designers ought to
understand the major playstyles and evaluate every game mechanic according to
how it supports the preferred playstyles of their intended audience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Assuming
we can agree that there are such things as &quot;Achievers&quot; and
&quot;Explorers,&quot; and that both kinds of gamer are worth attracting, how
can we uniquely reward each of these playstyles? (Note: I believe Socializers
are also worth attracting, but that's a different thread.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To appeal
to each of these types I come back to the main difference between them, which I
believe is an emphasis on what is concrete versus what is abstract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Consider
the old adage &quot;give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day; teach a man to
fish and he'll feed himself for a lifetime.&quot; You can imagine this kind of
conversation between an Achiever and an Explorer in a MMOG. The Achiever walks
up to an Explorer and asks, &quot;Hey, is the fishing good here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
Explorer, assuming that the Achiever needs a long-term solution, will reply by
explaining how sunlight, air temperature, water convection rates, and local
vegetation patterns interact to determine how likely the fish are to be biting
in any place at any time of day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>After
about ten seconds of this, the Achiever reaches into his backpack, pulls out a
Potion of Exploding, throws it into the water, and walks off with an armful of
the fish that float to the surface. And the Explorer will be left standing
there with his jaw hanging open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What's
going on here is that we have different concepts of what's important, but we
tend to assume that everyone else shares our style. When that proves not to be
true, we're surprised; we assume that the other person is a fool or a nut. In
fact, they're just operating under a different set of rules about what really
matters than the rules that we use.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
case of Achievers and Explorers, what really matters starts with externals and
internals, with form and function, with concrete facts and abstract theories.
(It doesn't end there, but it's the most important difference.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For the
Achiever, things and data are more valuable than ideas and feelings.
Intangibles like perceptions and theories and concepts aren't &quot;real&quot;;
they aren't things that can be collected and stored and spent and measured. So
Achievers prefer rewards that are immediate and material. The bigger the pile
of stuff, the more security you have in an inconstant world. (Killers, whom I
prefer to think of as &quot;Manipulators,&quot; also prefer concrete rewards.
But because their secondary motivation is change rather than the Achiever's
desire for stability, they're much more interested in spending than in saving.
Manipulators lust for the thrill of the kill, the rush of the object- or
person-manipulating experience.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorers
don't see as much value in objects as Achievers. As far as the typical Explorer
is concerned, anyone can collect tokens; what really matters is the knowledge
of the principles and effects of token-collecting. Explorers value seeing
beyond the external forms of things into the internal rules that determine the
functionality of things. Knowledge about a thing isn't particularly worthwhile
unless it gives you some insight into the structure of that thing and the
nature of that class of things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So what
about MMOGs? What does all this analysis tell us about specific game systems
and mechanics for rewarding both these kinds of gamers?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As noted
earlier, the Achiever's preference for concrete rewards makes them relatively
easy to satisfy. Cash and shiny loot, accurately keyed to the difficulty of the
challenge that was overcome to obtain them, are the main motivators for
Achievers. After that come the more social rewards, which we can summarize as
&quot;badges&quot; -- that is, public indicators of achievement. If you offer
them the chance to collect money, an interesting variety of pretty loot, and
plenty of public status markers, Achievers will play. (Note that these three
rewards constitute short-term, medium-term, and long-term inducements to
continued play.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorers
are harder to satisfy because their needs are more abstract. The key may be to
consider the difference between surface data that can be collected in bulk by
immediate observation (which Achievers can do) and analysis of data within
which patterns can be discerned and from which principles can be derived (these
being Explorer specialties).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This why
I keep harping on depth of systems. If all you have are surface connections, Achievers
will quickly do whatever grinding is necessary to list those. Game over, man!
But if there are deep and nonlinear connections within and between systems --
if different configurations produce different effects, and if those connections
can't be fully understood by simply grinding through all the possible options
-- then the people most likely to master these systems are Explorers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To
summarize: Achievers can discover facts, but Explorers discover principles.
Explorers will love a game that has deep principles and rewards the discovery
of those principles by the truly curious player. In a word, let Explorers
&quot;tinker&quot; with things. We love that; we'll spend all day tinkering
with things if you let us, and we'll feel rewarded in the process of tinkering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
way of highlighting this difference between Achievers and Explorers can be
summed up in the words &quot;factory&quot; and &quot;laboratory.&quot; Where an
Achiever will usually be interested in Production and Sales, an Explorer is
more likely to gravitate toward Research and Development.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Explorers
want to be &quot;creative.&quot; The opportunity to create new things will draw
Explorers like honey draws bears. But note that &quot;create new things&quot;
does not mean &quot;crank out a bunch of identical new objects.&quot; That's
Production, and it bores Explorers. (On the other hand, designing a new process
that increases productivity might not be boring at all to some Explorers.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What
Explorers want most, I believe, is the opportunity to design uniquely new
objects. A game that requires creativity and a deep understanding of
functionality to develop an entirely new class of objects, and which permits
players to do so, would instantly capture the enthusiasm of every Explorer.
Even better would be if this included the possibility of designing very large
and extremely complex systems that allow other players to tinker -- you
wouldn't be able to keep most Explorers away from such a thing! (Explorers
aren't tool-users; they're tool-builders.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Unfortunately,
this is tough to offer in a multiplayer game. &quot;Sandbox&quot; virtual
worlds allow players to create new objects. Second Life, for example, lets
players use its scripting system to create interesting new objects which can
then be manufactured for other SL players. Explorers tend to love Second Life
for this reason. But virtual worlds such as WoW and SWG that are much more
game-like almost never allow this level of creativity from players. In the
first place, there are technical constraints to allowing anyone/everyone to
generate unique kinds of objects; in the second place, there are serious
gameplay balance concerns related to giving players design powers; and in the
third place, publishers cite potential legal questions of who owns the
&quot;new&quot; player-created objects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
said all this, I believe there's an opportunity for a clever developer to allow
some kind of R&amp;D feature in a game world. Personally, I'd love to see this
in a MMOG in either a system allowing the design of new objects or new magic
spells (or, best of all, a way for intrepid players to discover new ways to
combine these two disciplines). But I recognize the difficulty in this; it may
simply be too time-consuming to create such a powerful feature when there are
more critical gameplay features that must be developed. (Although I would argue
that offering such an Explorer-friendly feature would go a very long way toward
creating a valuable balance between Achiever and Explorer subscription
numbers.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
it's possible that, rather than an in-game reward, Explorers might be better
motivated by meta-rewards, by benefits provided not in the game but outside the
game. (Presumably Achievers would find such rewards less satisfying.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Membership
in something like an &quot;Inventor's Network&quot; or &quot;Arcane
Association&quot; might be a nice reward for players who demonstrate both a
strong understanding of the principles of the more abstract gameplay features
and a willingness to help other players understand those features. (The
alternative of letting anyone mark themselves as a &quot;Helper&quot; was tried
in SWG. Mostly it just resulted in anyone so marked getting pestered for
handouts by beggars.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I suspect
it's the more social Explorers who'd value membership in a group as a reward, though.
Extroverted Explorers would probably enjoy such organizations. The less social
Explorers would probably prefer rewards that recognize curiosity and creativity
without requiring interaction with strangers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Honestly,
&quot;how to reward Explorers&quot; is a really hard problem. We don't even
know how to do this properly in real life! The typical Rational who quietly
figures out a principle will inevitably be overlooked by the company they work
for, while the Guardian or Artisan who applies the principle reaps the credit,
the cash, and the promotion. Application is just easier to see and appreciate
than design -- it's simply how we humans work, and I don't seriously expect the
developers of a multiplayer game to figure out a solution to that when so few
others have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The best
I can suggest is this: be aware that there are Explorers, and that they have
useful roles to play in a persistent game world. Try to design game systems for
them to explore in creative ways, but don't offer concrete rewards for doing so
-- focus instead on building world systems so deep and technically rich that
discovering their secrets is a satisfying long-term process in and of itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
should work. :-)</span></p>
