<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2003/11/03</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The thing
that makes real-life politics interesting is the balancing of powers. The
American example of carefully crafted constitutional checks and balances is the
obvious example, but pretty much any public organizational structure will pit
one power base against another. In some of today's nations there is a tension
between religious and secular leadership. Even dictatorships often split into
civilian and military power blocs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MMORPGs
that offer player cities and that want to stimulate player politics need a way
to create power blocs within city administrations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
games such as SWG have made a reasonable start at achieving this by letting
players be citizens of player cities, and by allowing players to become Mayors
of those cities. EVE Online has a more abstract version of this in which
players can be members or CEOs of corporations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These are
good starts, but they don't go far enough to really provoke political intrigue.
For that, a middle layer is necessary -- there needs to be a power group
between the leader and the citizens. Only when multiple players are able to
compete or cooperate to define and execute rules do you really see the kinds of
interactions that make politics so interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here's
how this might work. To use the analogy of a city, I'd like to see players able
to win seats on a City Council. Novice politicians could earn political points
serving as an executive assistant, or legislative staffer, or some such thing.
Once you earn enough political points to learn a City Council skill, you can
run for city council. (Council races would occur weekly, mayoral races would be
held independently once per month.) Election to the city council would give you
the ability (depending on the skill level) to do certain legislative things --
basically changing certain existing laws and sponsoring new ones, each of which
would generate political points. The city council would vote on these
&quot;bills,&quot; which if agreed to would go to the Mayor for signature or
veto. If vetoed, the council would have a chance (through another vote) to
override the veto.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
restructuring of the power system would have a number of positive effects on
gameplay. It would allow more people to be able to actively serve as
politicians, rather than only allowing one person to be Mayor. It establish a
tension between the executive (Mayor) and legislative (Council) power
structures -- the city council itself could become a political battlefield on
some issues. It could even set up &quot;insider&quot; vs. &quot;outsider&quot;
dynamics, as between someone who's sat on the city council for months (&quot;I
know this town, and I know its citizens&quot;) versus someone who's never held
public office (&quot;I've got fresh perspectives, and I'm not beholden to any
pressure group&quot;).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Something
similar could work for corporations. Holders of enough shares or proxies could
constitute a control board overseeing the actions of the corp's CEO.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Overall,
I think the simple citizen/Mayor system concentrates too much power in the
hands of one person. It's not a matter of fearing the corruption of power --
it's more that politics isn't as much fun if only one person can play.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We need
checks and balances. And babies to kiss!</span></p>
