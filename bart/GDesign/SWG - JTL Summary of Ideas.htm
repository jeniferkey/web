<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note:
Although version 4 of this document was posted on February 26, 2004, the
original version was posted on SOE’s official pre-launch forum in late 2002,
and most changes were merely cosmetic. It’s sort of fascinating to see how many
of the concepts described here made it into the Jump to Lightspeed expansion as
actually implemented.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>THE
NATURE OF SPACE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I expect
that &quot;space&quot; will be implemented as new areas that you can only reach
either by taking off from a planet, or by emerging from hyperspace. Each planet
will have a space area &quot;around&quot; it, and there may be other space
areas that exist independently of planets. From a space area, you will be able
to select a new destination from your ship's navigation system: either landing
on a particular planet (if you are in a space area around that planet), or
entering hyperspace to travel to a new space area. (Note: It is extremely unlikely
that you will be able to travel through a planet's atmosphere to land
&quot;manually,&quot; due to the potential for griefing. Atmospheric flight
remains a feature that most players want, however, so if it can be included
it'll make a lot of people very happy.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>OBJECTS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
space areas should contain asteroid fields. It should be possible to land on
sufficiently large asteroids (for mining, exploration, combat, etc.), and it
might be intereting to permit houses to be placed on asteroids, although only
special new &quot;enclosed&quot; types might be allowed. Allow gravity and
sensor-jamming effects near stars (but also allow &quot;burning up&quot; if one
gets too close to a star). Allow the &quot;Kessel Run,&quot; and possibly
something like &quot;pod racing in space&quot; where the goal is to navigate
through an obstacle cource in the least time. Gas clouds, comets, and other
stellar and interstellar objects should have appropriately entertaining effects
on ships. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SKILLS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
should be a number of new skills added with the Space Expansion, possibly
creating up to three new professions. The basic skills necessary for crafting
ships, flying them, fighting in them, fixing them, and transporting cargo in
them should be available as new starting professions. Appropriate skill trees
(disciplines) within the new professions could include: Spacecraft Piloting,
Spacecraft Navigation, Spacecraft Combat, Spacecraft Design, and Spacecraft
Construction/Repair. (Please see my &quot;Space Expansion: Proposed Skill
Trees&quot; document [# 4781 in this forum] for more details on one way to
implement these new skills.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SHIPS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You
should be able to walk around inside ships (especially capital ships, if
implemented) just as you can walk around inside a house. (This is probably the
single most popular player request.) A wide mix of ship types from the movies
and Expanded Universe (EU) should be available to players. Among the most
requested types of ships are: X-wing, Y-wing, A-wing, B-wing, TIE Fighter, TIE
Bomber, TIE Interceptor, Z-95 Headhunter, YT-1300 (Millenium Falcon), YT-2400, <i>Firespray</i>-class
policecraft (Slave Zero), Naboo starfighter, and <i>Lambda</i>-class shuttle.
(Note: I'm well aware that, following the Star Wars universe timeline, not all
of these ships are available in the period during which SWG is set. I've chosen
to list these ships along with the others in case the developers feel that
perfect fidelity to continuity is less important than having a rich fleet of
starships to choose from.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SYSTEMS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Spacecraft
should be complex structures composed of multiple subsystems. Each subsystem
should be a named physical unit that has attributes (quality, condition, max
speed, damage type, etc.), and with a few exceptions and limitations can: 1)
take damage, 2) be repaired, 3) be replaced, and 4) be upgraded. The key
systems are: hull, engines (hyperdrive and sub-lightspeed engines, as well as
power and fuel systems), weapons (lasers, ion guns, missiles/torpedoes, mines),
and defenses (deflector shields and armor). Other possible starship systems
could include: computers (including navicomp), sensors (and sensor-jamming or
-faking devices), communications (and communications jammers), accomodations
(crew berths and passenger staterooms), security (if ships can be boarded),
cargo bays, and escape pods. Ships, like other in-game structures, will require
regular maintenance payments in addition to repair, refit, and refueling costs.
Speaking of refueling, some appropriate method of fueling starships will need
to be devised that takes numerous points into account: refueling costs should
be a near-constant price of engaging in spaceflight, but should also recognize
that Star Wars is a high-tech universe (and thus presumably has high-tech
energy energy sources); what happens if you &quot;run out of gas&quot; in
space?; can you find fuel somewhere other than planets?; should there be
different types of fuels with different effects?; and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>USER
INTERFACE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Normal
space flight maneuvering and weapon firing will be controlled by mouse,
probably with some keyboard controls as well (such as for thrust/braking).
Joystick support would be welcome. The default button and key action
assignments should be consistent with those provided for vehicle control (once
that feature is implemented), but all keys and buttons used in the Space
Expansion should be fully remappable. Displays should be uncluttered and easy
to understand at a glance, with an audiovisual look-and-feel appropriate to the
origin of the ship's electronics (in other words, a TIE fighter's HUD should
look and sound different from that of an X-wing). Icons for ship-related
functions and commands should be added to the existing list in the Actions
screen. A ship's radar display should use appropriate color-coding and
symbology to indicate the relative positionl, facing, lockon status, and faction
of nearby ships.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>COMMUNICATION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A way to
communicate with other ships that fits within continuity is vital. Players must
be able to transmit nav coordinates (as waypoints) to each other's flight
computers so that they can remain in formation after flight through hyperspace.
It should be possible to target other ships or groups of ships on specific comm
channels and send short pre-composed commands (&quot;cover me!&quot;,
&quot;he's on your six!&quot;, etc.) through a hotkey. For players with
sufficient connection bandwidth, voice communication would be appreciated. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>FLIGHT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Flying
spacecraft will be &quot;twitch&quot;-based rather than purely RP. (Note: This
has already been called &quot;likely&quot; by the developers, and is supported
by existing video of game action.) In-flight maneuvering will be controlled by
the player in normal space, while hyperspace flight plans will be
pre-programmed into the navigation computer. Certain player skills or racial
stats may affect some in-flight actions (turning speed, defensive bonuses,
targeting bonuses, etc.). In particular, a Jedi player should receive bonuses
to ship control and combat proportionate to his Jedi rank. For
faster-than-light travel to another star system through hyperspace, the time
required to correctly program a navigation computer should increase with
distance to the target system and decrease based on the quality of the
navigation computer and the Navigation skill of the player doing the
programming. &quot;Hasty&quot; navigation should be possible, but should
increase the chance of exiting from hyperspace in an unplanned location. There
should always be some inaccuracy in where a ship exits hyperspace; this
inaccuracy can be minimized (though never completely eliminated) by improving
one's Navigation skills. Ships exiting hyperspace should never intersect an
existing spacecraft, although a badly calculated (or unlucky) course may result
in exiting hyperspace dangerously close to stellar objects such as asteroids
and stars. (Question: should ships emerge from hyperspace with their facing and
speed intact? Or should they emerge dead still and have to turn and speed up to
go anywhere?) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>COMBAT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ship-mounted
weapons should include those from the Star Wars movies; laser cannons and ion
cannons in particular. Lasers should cause damage to other ships, while ion
cannons should degrade the effectiveness of engines (and possibly other
electronics). Various types of missiles (small, fast, variable accuracy),
torpedoes (big, slow, highly accurate), and mines (contact, proximity, and
time-delay) should be available to make tactics more interesting. Multiplayer
ships larger than starfighters may have direct-fire turrets or batteries that
can be controlled by a player. If it's possible to walk around on some ships,
then let ships be able to dock with each other in space, and allow for boarding
parties. Faction should determine whether a player-controlled ship can fire on
or dock with another player-controlled ship without the targeted player's
consent. (The rules for firing on or docking with NPC ships may vary slightly
from this, but faction should still be considered.) The &quot;lock-on&quot;
system currently used for ground combat should be sufficient for direct-fire
weapons, but certain other weapons and commands should require
&quot;active&quot; lock-ons in which it's not enough to merely target some
object; your ship's targeting system must then acquire its own target lock.
Once this is done, you should be able to use &quot;fire-and-forget&quot;
weapons such as missiles and torpedoes, as well as attempt to break another
ship's sensor jamming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>CRAFTING</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ships
should be made of standard sets of parts, which must be combined using
schematics by someone with skills from the Spacecraft Construction discipline
-- basically they're built using the same system by which architects build planetary
structures. (They should also be able to build spacecraft-specific furnishings
as architects do for houses. &quot;Hey, where does this Nemoidian Birdcage
go?&quot;) Some parts necessary for spacecraft should be relatively simple
components that require Engineering skills from the Artisan profession (so
they'll have a useful part to play in the Space Expansion). Spacecraft systems
can be repaired and/or replaced, but you can't add new systems without a new
design. A ship's owner should be allowed to place &quot;decals&quot; (selected
from a very comprehensive pre-built list) on that ship to allow
distinctiveness. (Or the owner might have to find a Spacecraft Constructor to
do this in the same way that an Image Designer is necessary to change the
appearance of player characters.) Ship hull types available should be those
that can be purchased by players and PAs. Multiple configurations for certain
hull types is a very popular player request -- players want to be able to have
distinctive vehicles. Players might not be permitted to craft capital ships,
such as Nebulon-B frigates, Mon Calamari cruisers, and Imperial Star
Destroyers, but the rare inclusion of these ships in some way (possibly
NPC-commanded, or controlled by Live Team members for special events) would be
hugely entertaining in creating that &quot;Star Wars&quot; feeling. If capital
ships can be constructed by players, require that construction take place in
(probably orbital) spacecraft construction yards. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>COMMERCE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Freighters
should be one of the available ship types that offer some number of
&quot;spaces&quot; for carrying items (similar to item counts in houses). If
being able to move around inside ships is not implemented, then there should be
a communications subsystem that allows goods to be bought and sold electronically
and &quot;automatically&quot; moved into and out of the cargo hold. It should
be possible to carry passengers, although this system will need to be carefully
constructed to minimize grief play (e.g., &quot;kidnapping&quot; other players
instead of taking them where they want to go). If walking around on ships is
implemented, it should be possible to craft starships with multiple staterooms
of varying quality; NPCs and players could then require appropriate levels of
accomodation when traveling (and pay accordingly). It should be possible to
carry vehicles on board a ship, cargo space permitting. Finally, one of the
most-requested features has been hidden cargo spaces (for smuggling).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MISSIONS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The Space
Expansion should open up many new missions that occur in space or require objects
or skills specifically related to the Space Expansion. Missions that require
space travel or space-related skills should be selectable at terminals related
to space assets: starports, space stations, and communications terminals inside
ships themselves. There should be a good mix of missions: escort, rescue, and
straight faction-based combat for those who want to fly starfighters primarily,
and delivery missions (including smuggling) of freight, cargo, and passengers.
(Note that &quot;freight&quot; is merchandise you transport for someone else
for a flat fee, while &quot;cargo&quot; is merchandise you speculatively buy on
Planet A and sell on Planet B in the hope of making a profit.) Other missions
should be available for those players who want to work in space but who either
can't afford or don't want to own and operate their own spacecraft -- survey,
salvage, and exploration missions, for example. Space Expansion missions should
also be integrated into the &quot;player missions&quot; system when/if that's
implemented. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>OTHER
POPULAR CONCEPTS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
possibility of large and complex capital ships being available as places to
adventure is broadly and strongly supported. Space stations would also be nice
to have. Another concept with fairly vocal support (but some disagreement) is
that military-class ships should only be available to overt faction players.
Astromech droids (like R2-D2) should be allowed to improve the status of and
enhance the effectiveness of ship systems. There should be minigames such as
Dejarik (the game popularly known as &quot;holochess&quot;) available for
playing on multiplayer ships. Ships should be able to carry ore from asteroid
mining operations. Ships should broadcast ID codes (possibly with IFF) from a
&quot;black box&quot; transponder, but it might be possible to alter that ID
code (for a high price, a short time, and with severe penalties if caught).
Capital ships destroyed in space should leave behind some wreckage out of which
a few useful items might be salvaged -- possibly a &quot;/salvage&quot; command
similar to the &quot;/forage&quot;-type commands could be applied. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>UNLIKELY
WISH LIST</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
options not really expected but that would be nice to have include: atmospheric
flight and manual landing (not likely given the programming effort required and
opportunity for griefing), planetary bombardment (needs anti-griefing limits
that may make it too unrealistic), mine-laying, PA ownership of capital ships,
and commodore- or admiral-level control of multi-ship fleets.</span></p>
