<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For you
folks who feel as strongly as I do about the value of non-combat content: Why
are you commenting on this to Rogue_5?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Read his
responses in this thread -- they are brief answers to specific questions
concerning how the planned PvP and Bounty Hunter features will work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Questions
on non-combat subjects (such as turning Entertainers into combatants, and the
impact to the player-run economy of adding armor as a loot drop and of ceasing
to address mudflation by turning off no-trade and biolinking for many objects)
are simply not going to be acknowledged, much less answered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. Why be
surprised at an apparent disinterest in the gameplay of non-combatants? This is
not by any stretch of the imagination some new approach on SOE's part.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>a. If
non-combat gameplay mattered, the NGE would not have eliminated so many
non-combat professions, nor would the new non-combat classes have been treated
so differently compared to the combat classes. Nobody asked for classes and
levels like Every Other Game, but non-combatants didn't even get that -- if
when you respec'ed you knew one non-com skill, you got 'em all. It's as though
the feeling was, &quot;if it's not a combat skill, it's not worth asking people
to earn it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The NGE
changes were just a continuation of the long-standing attitude toward
non-combatants: minimal attention is all that's required to retain those odd
people who aren't into 24x7 combat gameplay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>b. When
Helios_SOE was asked at the CU-related Stratics chat back in April of 2005 how
non-combatants could survive a game world filled with much nastier mobs, his
response was, &quot;If you wish to gather resources in dangerous areas, you should
either get a PSG or you could also hire some other players to protect you in
the wilds.&quot; (See my remarks about that at <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=csystems&amp;message.id=54959">http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=csystems&amp;message.id=54959</a>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>c. I
twice put together a spreadsheet that examined every single documented change
made since SWG launched -- in the second version, all the way up to publish
23.04 (Sept. 15, 2005). In it, I categorized every change on multiple aspects,
such as whether it was a new feature, a change or a bugfix; on whether it was
about combat, crafting, entertaining, etc.; on which gameplay features were
affected (houses, PAs, travel, space, etc.); and on which professions were most
affected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Analyzing
this data confirmed what I'd long believed, which was that since SWG launched,
the vast majority of significant new features were combat-specific, while the
superb crafting system with which SWG originally launched was allowed to
languish with virtually no major new content. (Highlights of this research can
be seen at <a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note that
adding new schematics from time to time does not constitute &quot;major new
content&quot; -- not when compared against things like the Force Village or the Combat Upgrade.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>d. To see
this in an anecdotal way, consider a series of questions I have repeatedly
asked:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where is
grouping for crafters? Where's the equivalent of a Hermit Quest for
entertainers? Where's anything like Jabba's themepark or Nym's themepark or the
Imperial or Rebel themeparks for merchants? Where's a Nightsister or Geonosian Cave for medics? When will non-combatants get any content even remotely
resembling the scope of the Corellian Corvette, or the Deathwatch Bunker, or
the entire planet of Kashyyyk?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I've
never gotten an answer to these questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It would
be nice to get answers now, but I don't believe there's any reason for us to
expect that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now, all
this said -- I'm not a pessimist. So for all of us who long for deep virtual worlds
with richly interactive gameplay, let me offer this tiny glimmer of hope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Nancy
MacIntyre, LucasArts senior director for SWG, has suggested that a SWG2 might
be in the works for a 2008/2009 release. OK, that's extremely tentative in all
counts; might not happen at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But what
if it <i>is</i> happening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Suppose
production of a SWG2 really is part of the LucasArts business plan. Perhaps the
intention is to transmogrify SWG into something for a &quot;broader
audience&quot; (i.e., console players), while SWG2 is being designed (perhaps
by a band of Rebels in a hidden base) as the rich and challenging Star Wars
Galaxies the rest of us dream of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And maybe
this time, it won't needlessly exclude those paying customers who actually do
enjoy playing as Uncle Owen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Just a
thought.</span></p>
