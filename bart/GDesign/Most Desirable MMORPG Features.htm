<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Most Desirable MMORPG
Features</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/03/21</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My short
list of &quot;what would keep me playing a MMOG for years&quot; looks a little
something like this:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Balance.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'd like
to see a game developed in which all the systems were explicitly designed to
fit together smoothly. More specifically, I'd like to see a game in which there
is a conscious, deliberate determination on the part of the developers to
create and maintain balances all through the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1a.
Playstyle balance.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Combat
should not be the only focus of development -- catering to today's hardcore
gamers will not bring in the many, many more potential gamers out there. Combat
is an important feature to provide, because today's gamers do matter; it's just
not a good long-term strategy to focus on current gamers exclusively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I'd
like to see a game in which combat gameplay is effectively balanced with the
other major gameplay styles: commerce/crafting, exploration, and social. Treat
these other in-game abilities as equally worthy of respect when providing new
game content. If combat gets some major new content, so should the other
playstyles -- maybe not in the same release, but overall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1b.
Game vs. world balance.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MMOGs are
games, so gameplay matters. But MMOGs are also worlds, so immersiveness
matters, too. Both of these aspects of MMOGs ought to be balanced with respect
to each other -- the gameplay should deepen the lore and appearance and
emotional depth of the game world, and most world enhancements should try to
sharpen and make more exciting the gameplay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
particular, this means not imposing out-of-context gameplay. If it's felt that
some common gameplay feature &quot;has&quot; to be provided, find a way to
provide it that fits within and enhances all the other parts of the game and
world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And don't
be afraid to add some world features just for fun. Some of the most memorable
parts of games are the offhanded bits that didn't have to exist, that had no
gameplay functionality or value, but that fleshed out an NPC or a location in a
believable or fun way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1c.
Skill balance.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Skills --
especially at higher power levels -- need to come with a balance of strengths
and weaknesses. For every benefit, there should be some appropriate cost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That cost
could be a cost to use the ability, or a weakening of some other ability, or a
susceptibility to negative effects, or some similar consequence of choosing to
use the high-end ability, but it needs to exist. A powerful and useful ability
with only positive consequences winds up being something every player wants,
and the result is templating and cookie-cutter characters. Balancing ability
strengths with weaknesses helps insure that players will choose different
skills, helping each character define his or her unique identity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
Crafting as a process that's fun in itself, not just as a means to a
predetermined result.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
various reasons, too many designers have treated crafting as a mere support
function for supplying combatants with gear. The focus is placed on the outputs
because those outputs are what non-crafters care about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But if
crafting were primarily about being fun for crafters, and secondarily about
supplying gear to other players, the focus would shift from the results of
crafting to the process of crafting itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To make
the process of crafting fun for crafters means allowing for surprise. If I
follow the same recipe and get the same output every time, there's no surprise
-- in fact, there's no crafting; what I'm doing is mere production, a purely
result-oriented system. A fun crafting system would focus on making the <i>process</i>
of crafting fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
process of crafting should be consistent enough to be experimentable, but deep
and nonlinear enough to allow the results of experimentation to be surprising.
By &quot;experimentable&quot; I mean that if the inputs could be held exactly
the same between two crafting sessions, the outputs would be the same. This
allows for science -- the forming of a hypothesis about how a process works,
testing to evaluate the hypothesis, and reevaluation of the hypothesis. And by
&quot;deep and nonlinear&quot; I mean that there are generally a lot of inputs
to producing any item, and it's really, really hard to perfectly control all
the inputs; there's some variation in inputs between runs. This helps lead to
results that aren't totally surprising (you'll always get a sword if you use
sword-making inputs), but that aren't totally predictable, either (each sword
will have slightly different qualities).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To
accomplish this, a crafting system needs two specific features. One is that the
attributes of the inputs should be reflected in the qualities of the outputs.
If I have a recipe for making candy that calls for some liquid as an input,
using pure water should generate a different kind of candy than using grain
alcohol. When I make a sword blade, that blade should have different qualities
depending on whether I used bronze or steel or meteoric iron, on the amount and
type of carbon I added from my fire, on the temperature of my fire, and on the
liquid (water? olive oil? blood?) in which I quenched the blade to temper it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
should also mean that whatever strengths and weaknesses an input has, both are
transmitted to the final product in proportion to the amount of those inputs. A
particular type of iron could be both very strong but very brittle, leading to
a sword made with that iron having those properties as well. The corollary to
this is that every input should have both strengths and weaknesses. This will
insure that it's really, really hard to come up with a &quot;perfect&quot;
object... or, worse, a perfect formula for making perfect objects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The other
desirable feature is a &quot;construction kit&quot; approach to crafting.
Making a thing -- especially a new kind of thing -- should be a product of
combining numerous components in many possible ways, and of altering components
and groups of components through many different possible processes. The fun of
crafting comes from playing (in the best sense of that word) with different
inputs and processes to see what comes out at the end. Ultimately it should be
possible to build large-scale and highly complex objects with reasonable but
somewhat surprising behaviors, as long as the crafter is willing to take the
pains necessary to make each individual piece work and put all the pieces
together properly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Real
crafters <i>like</i> trial and error! Other types of people can't stand this
approach because they're so strongly result-oriented that all they see is the
error. Crafters love this kind of thing because they perceive every
&quot;failure&quot; as an addition to their sum of knowledge about materials
and processes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'd
happily play a game whose crafting system was designed by someone who actually
enjoys crafting and understands crafters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
more, but to sum up: Give me crafting as a process, and take pains that it and
exploring and socializing are always treated as no less valuable than combat,
and I'm there for the duration.</span></p>
