<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I like
the idea of professions that are explicitly for combat support. Combat Medic is
the prototype, but there could be others to fill the other kinds of roles you
find in military operations: communications, logistics (if supply were as
important in this game as in Real Life), PsyOps (this one could be fun, but the
griefing potential probably dooms it), intel (now THIS one could work -- look
at all the &quot;spy&quot; PAs that have already been created), etc. These
professions might give minor bonuses to some pure combat skills, but would
otherwise be focused on support abilities. The Squad Leader profession would
also benefit indirectly from having more useful functions to integrate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
said this, I don't think it would be appropriate to graft combat support
functions onto otherwise non-fighting professions. Again, I think we do better
over the long run to find more ways to let crafters be crafters (and likewise
for the other non-combat professions), rather than tacking unrelated combat
features onto them. We need to find ways for fighters to depend more on crafters
(AND vice-versa!), rather than expecting crafters and other to participate in
direct combat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, consider the concept of fighters providing protection for parties
moving through the wilderness toward their homes, harvesters, or mission objectives.
It’s not clear to me why &quot;caravan guard&quot; hasn't turned into a more
popular in-game role. There's no game-specific function for it, but it seems
like something that would have emerged on its own... but it sure doesn't look
that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>I can only figure a couple reasons why not:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>1) It's too easy for crafters to pick up combat skills. For
example, I'm a Master Artisan and near-Master Merchant, yet I'm about to pick
up my fourth skill level in Pistol. It's handy to be able to collect my own
Hides (especially with prices skyrocketing), but I use it for defense as well
-- I actually got chased into my home/shop by some swamp rats. They got me, but
I got one of them first. On top of that, I've got /maskscent and improved
/burstrun... so explain to me again why I need to hire guards?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>2) The rewards offered aren't enough of an inducement. If combat
types are able to pull down kilocredits for a relatively simple mission, it's
not likely that any of them will be interested in the Cr2000 I can offer for
eliminating the narglatches camped out in my front yard. I honestly believe
that the rewards for missions have been and continue to be WAAAAAY too high.
Fighters, for the most part, ought to be cash-poor; there ought to be
gazilliions of ways for them to lose money and only a few ways -- mostly
dependent on working for non-fighters -- to earn money. (Yes, I know this
viewpoint will not make me popular with combat-oriented folks OR with
high-level armor- and weaponsmiths. So be it; all these folks were able to advance
far too quickly due to excessive fighter cash.) It would be nice to have other
inducements than monetary, too -- maybe other players should be able to hire
fighters, and after so many engagements be able to offer rank levels -- Guard,
Guard Sergeant, Guard Lieutenant, Captain of the Guard, etc., with uniforms and
badges (REAL badges, not text!) as are in each case appropriate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>OK, now it's my turn to offer ideas to get shot down. (Hey, fair
is fair.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>1. It was originally planned that low-level artisans would be able
to craft components for items that only elite crafters could build, and that
the skill point control system would force high-level crafters to give up
low-level crafting skills (thereby creating a market for low-level crafters to
profit by making components). Didn't happen. But maybe we should revive at
least some of the basic idea -- how about requiring more low-level components
for high-level items? Complex devices should need lots of simpler parts (and
NOT from factory crates, either).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>2. To extend this idea on the other side, I'd like to see more
&quot;multi-disciplinary&quot; objects -- in other words, there ought to be
really complex items that need components that can only be crafted by entirely
different professions. This would do multiple Good Things: It would extend the
game for high-level crafters; it would create more interaction among players
(and professions); it would open up more opportunities for lower-level crafters
(to supply the components, see #1 above); and it would put more cool things in
the game for other players to enjoy. As examples of the kinds of things I mean,
I think of shopping malls, vehicles (once that patch is released), power
stations (for vehicles), and even space stations and maybe capital ships (once
the Space Expansion is released). Also, there is talk of a City Planner
profession... maybe they'll need advanced artisans in some way...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>3. What about factioned artisan objects? This would be a way for
artisans to participate in the Galactic Civil War in a meaningful way. Off the
top of my head, I think of things like fortifications and gun emplacements, and
perhaps even the various types of Imperial walkers, but I'm sure there are lots
of other faction-related items that crafters could create that could be tied to
the movies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>4. More mission types, please. Crafters ought to be able to
exercise their four key functions -- creating, maintaining, repairing, and
enhancing -- on darn near any object, and there ought to be all kinds of
missions and places in which to exercise those distinct but related skills.
(Speaking of enhancing, I don't mind letting Bounty Hunters do slicing on
electronics and containers, but letting them do weapon and armor improvement is
a mistake. Item enhancement ought to be restricted to crafters.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>5. Bodies of water are almost completely worthless in SWG, and
that's a shame. If REAL swimming were an option, we could create all sorts of
water-related devices: snorkels, the rebreathers Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan used in
Ep. I, submersible vehicles, oil rigs, floating houses....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>6. Ditto #4, except in the air. (Although this would be badly open
to griefing unless the fastest vehicle available was a helium-filled dirigible,
but we really do need some way to recreate Bespin.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>7. Finally -- and we're getting a little way-out here -- what if
there was a kind of crafter that resembled the Settlers/Engineers from the
Civilization games? In other words, what if we could alter the terrain?
Although to prevent griefing there'd have to be some seriously stout controls
on what could be done, what if it were possible to build roads (which, frankly,
ought to offer movement bonuses)? How about clearing trees? Would it be useful
to those planting harvesters, do you think, to pay someone to level a piece of
ground over a particularly rich resource site? Speaking of resources, why not
offer a skill that improves the percentages of a particular resource in a
single location (possibly reducing the percentages of randomly-selected other
resources nearby)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>I know not all these ideas are good ones. Others might be good,
but are unrealistic. Ultimately, the point is to come up with ideas for
additional content for non-combat players. Most won't be used, but if even just
a few are, then we're better off and it was worth it.</span></p>
