<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why do we
assume that players who choose combat skills over economic skills should be
able to make lots of money?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
isn't an anti-fighter question or a pro-crafter question. It's about gameplay
balance. MMOGs tend to have some skills that are obviously intended to allow
characters to make money, and some skills that are obviously about defeating
players/NPCs/mobs in combat. So why should anyone think that those who
specialize in combat skills ought to be able to make lots of money by killing
mobs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Letting
master combatants amass towering piles of cash by defeating enemies through
strength of arms makes no more sense than letting a master merchant buy a high
military rank or an advanced weapon certification. We don't let economic
abilities translate to a high combat rating -- why do we let combat abilities
translate to a high economic rating?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Fighters
get a number of unique rewards from using their combat skills: combat XP,
weapon XP, weapon certifications, military rank titles, interesting loot items
(sometimes), and the thrill of the kill. Crafters get different rewards from
using their economic skills: money, and the satisfaction that comes from
creating things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So why
should fighters expect to get economic rewards in addition to the rewards they
already get from combat activities? Crafting offers only a couple of rewards.
Giving fighters access to one of the few crafting rewards in addition to the
numerous rewards combat already provides only reduces the perceived respect for
crafting as a valued playstyle. Crafters provide unique services to a game
world. They should retain unique rewards.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Fighters
ought to be poor but deadly, and non-fighters ought to be weak but wealthy.
This creates opportunities for useful interactions between both types of
players -- crafters should need fighters to protect them, and fighters should
need crafters to give them jobs to do to make money. This would mean that
fighters wouldn't be able to buy that great armor or superweapon the first week
they start playing a MMOG because they ground out a bunch of high-paying
quests. It would also mean that crafters wouldn't be able to obtain resources
or valuable items without the help of capable fighters. Players would benefit
from working together to help each other do better over time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Basically,
if you want to make money, spend your skill points on crafting/economic skills.
If you want to be able to defend yourself physically in PvE or PvP, spend your
skill points on fighting skills. Don't expect to be able to make a lot of money
or be safe from physical challenge if you aren't willing to pay for the skills
that allow you to do so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>No one
player style should have access to all player rewards. Ultimately, that leads
to the worst sin any game can commit: being boring.</span></p>
