<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note: All
the hairy details are in this initial message, but I've now added a message
that summarizes these ideas later in this thread (about 9 messages down).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I've been
a crafter since SWG was released. In addition to mastering the Artisan and
Merchant professions, I've picked up and used Novice-or-better skills from all
the advanced crafting professions branching from the Engineering discipline.
I've enjoyed crafting, but for a while now something has been bothering me
about crafting in SWG. I think I've been able to put my finger on what it is:
there's no surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>I. THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
design of the crafting system in SWG is highly result-oriented, rather than
being process-oriented. In other words, the point is what you get at the end of
crafting, rather than the act of crafting itself. That's good for making sure
that other players have the things they need, but it can leave crafters feeling
a bit like mere cogs in a product distribution machine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
than being a bit boring, there's nothing really wrong with crafting's
result-oriented design. There are actually a number of good ideas well
implemented. The idea of schematics is good. The concept of needing different
kinds of resources and subcomponents in schematics is good. The concept of
resources having different attributes that condition the effectiveness of the
final product is good. And the concept of experimentation is good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
something is missing. The design focus on results over process has left the act
of crafting an exercise in grinding, rather than allowing crafting to be
something that's fun in its own right because the process itself is
interesting. If I may suggest the source of this problem: the assembly and
experimentation steps are too simple to allow for surprise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What
makes engineering (more specifically, &quot;invention&quot;) fun in the real
world is that you don't always know exactly what you're going to get. The
behavior of complex objects isn't normally a pass/fail, perfect/junk kind of
thing (as in SWG) -- complex real-world objects often live in a gray area of
functionality. When you put many odd-shaped things together in different ways,
when you try new kinds of parts as subcomponents, it's hard to know precisely
how the final object will look or act. Real-world objects demonstrate
unpredictable and even surprising behaviors precisely because they are complex.
This element of surprise is what makes real-world &quot;crafting&quot; an
interesting and fun process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
there's no chance of anything interesting happening when assembling or
experimenting on an item in SWG because you always know exactly what you're
going to get. With a few exceptions (certain armor and weapon schematics can
take an optional component), you always assemble the same components in the
same amounts, and they always go together in exactly the same way. As for experimentation,
the only question is whether you'll have to craft your prototype for practice
XP because one of your experiments yielded a result less than &quot;great
success.&quot; This player focus on only accepting &quot;perfect&quot; products
is the natural result of a crafting design that's focused on results for other
players instead of being a fun process for the crafters themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But what
if not getting exactly what you wanted didn't always mean that the result was
unusable? What if not all surprises were bad (as they are now with critical
fails)? In short, what if you could have &quot;interesting failures?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
four changes I'd like to see made to crafting in order to allow for surprise,
and thus for a crafting experience that's a lot more fun:</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Complex
     objects should have multiple appearance and performance characteristics
     beyond simple numeric attributes.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
     attributes of the resources used to craft an object should be reflected in
     the appearance and/or performance of the final product.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The

     failures in experimentation should be balanced by critical successes.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's
look at each of these suggestions in more detail to see how it would help
contribute to a more interesting and satisfying crafting experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>III. DISCUSSION OF CHANGES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
PERFORMANCE/APPEARANCE CHARACTERISTICS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If every
instance of a particular crafted object looks and acts the same way, surprise
is impossible. This isn't always a bad thing -- you wouldn't want significant
variation in products manufactured by a factory, for example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
constructed objects need to have a wide variety of appearance and performance
characteristics if variation in materials and processes are to allow for
surprising results. If an object always looks the same and always has the same
operational characteristics, then what's the point of making such an object
except to have one? Where's the joy in the process of creating the item?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The three
most common appearance characteristics are color, shape, and size. Clothing is
allowed color customization options (and Tailors are given more color
customization options than Artisans) because it's understood that making
clothing (which doesn't allow experimentation) would be incredibly boring
otherwise. Another example of appearance customization is a pistol whose scope
and stock have been selected from a list of optional types, and which displays
those selected scope and stock types when the crafted pistol is examined. And
of course we now have basic (frame and trim) customization kits for droids and
vehicles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These
options should be extended to many more items. Objects should be capable of
having different colors; they should be craftable in a range of sizes; their
shapes should be allowed to vary in well-defined ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, consider a simple object: a staff. Why must all staves be the same
length? And why brown? Sure, trees on Earth have brown wood... but we're not on
Earth! Similarly, why should even more complex objects all look the same? Must
the engines always be in the same place on a landspeeder? Why are there only
about ten types of house plans in the entire galaxy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As for
performance characteristics, these include the obvious ones -- min and max
damage, range-based to-hit modifiers, and attack speed for weapons, for
example, as well as other purely numeric attributes -- but objects have other
features that should be variable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Consider
ranged weapons: when you fire them, they have a visual effect (such as a
blaster bolt) and they make a sound. What if these effects could vary? Maybe
blaster bolts can come in different colors (like lightsabers). Maybe the sound
effect can be pitched differently, or perhaps it has a different duration. You
wouldn't want to allow too much variety in these attributes since they're
considered defining features for those objects. But some reasonable variation
should be possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
performance characteristics that should vary between objects include: bonuses
or weaknesses versus certain mobs or classes of mobs; special behaviors in
certain environments (desert, forest, water, nighttime); alternate-fire modes
(for some weapons); vehicle top speeds, turn rates, and acceleration rates; droid
intelligence and loyalty; and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2.
RESOURCE ATTRIBUTES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Once
you've established that objects can have many different kinds of varying
features, you need a way to relate those features to the materials used to
construct objects.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The good
news is that we're already partway to achieving this because the resource
system already allows a great deal of variation. For example, there are several
types of Mineral (Metal, Ore, Radioactives); two types of Metal (Ferrous and
Non-Ferrous); two types of Non-Ferrous Metal (Aluminum and Copper); several
types of Copper (Mythra, Platinite, etc.); and several places (Lok, Naboo,
etc.) where you can get that kind of Copper. All these attributes could
contribute to the qualities of the final product creating using them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's use
the staff again as our example. It's made out of wood, but that wood can be of
three types, and can come from any planet. That's thirty different types of
wood right there! Why shouldn't the type of wood used contribute to the
performance of the staff, and to its appearance? Let's assume that the basic
numeric attributes don't vary (since otherwise we'd have people complaining
&quot;I can't make staffs!&quot; because the &quot;best&quot; wood currently
has lousy stats).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Maybe
wood from Lok causes staves to be tinted green. Maybe deciduous wood does extra
kinetic damage because it's harder than evergreen or coniferous wood, but this
also makes staves made from deciduous wood decay much faster than those made
from evergreen or coniferous wood. Maybe Endorian Evergreen Wood has minerals
in it that make it particularly effective against any kind of spider. Maybe
objects crafted from coniferous wood from Yavin IV glow in the dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>See how
this works? Crafting currently doesn't make nearly enough use of resource
attributes in determining properties of the final product... but it could.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3.
SUBCOMPONENT CONFIGURATION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For more
complex objects which include subcomponents, appearance and performance
characteristics should be related to how the crafter chooses to connect these
component parts to each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
current system you make a bunch of similar subcomponents, then another set of
other similar subcomponents, then a few more subcomponents, then you take them
all and, with some raw resources, lay them out flat on a table, hit the
&quot;assemble&quot; button, and hey presto!, you've built an item. (Assuming
you don't get a critical fail on assembly.) While this does at least recognize
that complex items tend to be built from subcomponents, it doesn't recognize
the importance of allowing crafters to vary the organization of those
subcomponents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
variation on the above scenario, suppose instead that you craft four similar
subcomponents. When you lay them out to construct the larger item that is composed
of these pieces, you get to choose how you want those pieces to be connected to
each other. (I imagine the crafting tool GUI letting you click to draw lines
between subcomponents to indicate configuration connections.) One configuration
might improve the final item's durability at the cost of some of its power;
another might give you the same type of item but one that's brittle but very
effective; a third configuration might give you mediocre performance attributes
but some kind of additional special power.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For very
complex products that require many different subcomponents, you should have
numerous options for how to interconnect the pieces -- so many, in fact, that
it's effectively impossible to predict the exact final qualities of the
finished assembled object.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
should still be some predictability in this process. Making two complex objects
with the same configuration of subcomponents should yield two items with
similar appearance and performance characteristics. But where the artisan has
choices for how the subcomponents of a complex object can fit together, those
choices should affect the features of the finished component.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:white'>4. CRITICAL SUCCESSES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
final suggestion, if critical failures -- either in assembly or experimentation
-- can ruin a crafted object, shouldn't critical successes also be possible?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Just as a
critical failure is an &quot;I don't know what I did wrong!&quot; situation, a
critical success would represent the rare &quot;I don't know how I did it but
WOW!&quot; situation. To allow only horrible results is both unrealistic and
not &quot;fair&quot; in a game context.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
two obvious ways to reflect critical success situations. I propose that each of
these two possibilities be implemented, one for the assembly phase, and one for
experimentation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(In the
discussion that follows, please note that a critical success is not the same
thing as an &quot;amazing success&quot; result any more than a critical failure
is the same thing as a &quot;moderate failure&quot; result. &quot;Critical
success&quot; should either be a new result type, or the &quot;amazing
success&quot; result type should be enhanced in the ways described here.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
assembly phase, just as a critical failure results in the complete loss of all
resources and subcomponents, a critical success should result in the crafting
of the desired item without using up any resources or components. The risk of
losing all materials (in a critical failure) should be balanced by the
potential reward of getting to keep all your materials (in a critical success).
(Note that this would not apply to Architect-only schematics since these are no
longer subject to the threat of loss in a critical failure. Just as Architect
objects aren't subject to the risk of loss, they should always be used up no
matter what the result of assembly.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
obvious result of a critical success in the experimentation phase should be
object performance that is better than would normally be possible. The features
improved should only be those on which experimentation points were spent, and
performance should only be improved proportional to the number of
experimentation points spent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
potential problem with this enhancement would be that some individuals with
excessive free time and plenty of patience might be inclined to try to make all
their objects &quot;perfect&quot; with critical successes on all
experimentation attempts. This is unlikely to be effective for several reasons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First,
the percentage rate of critical successes should be about 1% for everyone.
(This would still favor Master crafters, since they have more experimentation
points to spend than other crafters.) A 1% critical success rate would make
these events sufficiently rare that someone who wants to craft only perfect
items would only be able to create perhaps two or three such items per day.
Given how good these items would be, how in demand they would be, and how much
money high-end players have, a crafter would not be able to keep such items
stocked (nor any other items if he spends all his time trying to craft perfect
items!), not even if he could craft 24/7 with macros that somehow knew how to
keep only perfect items.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Second,
the maximum possible improvement would only be possible by either using up all
your experimentation points in one burst and getting a critical success on that
attempt, or by getting a critical success result for each and every experiment
attempt. In the former case, a 1% success rate would mean harvesting resources
and crafting subcomponents only to destroy all of them 99 times for every one
&quot;perfect&quot; item created. The cost of doing this (particularly for very
high-end items) would likely not be recoverable through the sale of the one
perfect item. As for trying to use experimentation points separately, a 1%
critical success rate and 10 or more experimentation points to spend makes getting
10 critical successes in a row not very likely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Overall,
implementing critical successes would be one more way to allow the rare and
pleasant surprises that make crafting fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>[<span
style='color:black'>2005/03/30</span>: It's come to my attention that critical
success results, while rare, are now possible. It's probably not implemented in
the way I've described it above, but any progress here is appreciated!]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By
offering variability in crafted object features, by allowing crafters to have
lots of choices in resource usage and subcomponent configurations, and by
making those choices have different results in finished products, you take the
focus off of repeatedly grinding out the same thing over and over again, and

differentiate their products from those of other crafters. That would be tons
more fun for crafters, plus product differentiation would help them market the

#1 (which is what I started this thread to address) is &quot;how do we make
crafting more fun for crafters?&quot; Question #2 (which was brought up later) is
&quot;how do we insure useful participation in the game economy for both novice
and master crafters?&quot; Both of these are good questions, but we need to
bear in mind that they are two different questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
particular, the difference between these questions is that each one is based on
a different assumption about what crafting is for. If you hold the assumption
that crafting is about supplying players with necessary and desirable goods
--in other words, if crafting is valuable mostly for its results -- then the
way to judge the crafting system is to see how well it allows both novices and
masters to participate usefully in the game economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If on the
other hand your natural assumption is that crafting is about the creative
experience, that it's mostly valuable to the degree to which crafters
themselves enjoy crafting, then you're asking question #1, not question #2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>progman63's
suggestion for graduated abilities to crafting and using items addresses
question #1 more than it addresses question #2. But that's not a flaw in his
suggestion as I don't believe it was intended to go into the economic aspects
of crafting. The economic repercussions of restructuring crafting for crafters
is a good question to ask as a follow-up, but it's not entirely fair to criticize
his suggestion for not addressing something it wasn't intended to directly
address.</span></p>

there's a simple solution to this. In fact, SWG already uses it: the less

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you're
a Novice Artisan, the items you can make should be quite simple. Their
schematics should call for only a few easy-to-obtain resources and no
subcomponents. As you gain skill levels, the schematics for craftable objects
should become increasingly complex. At the Master level, schematics should
require several rare resources and subcomponents that are themselves
constructed from subcomponents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Furthermore
(to follow my original suggestions), experimentation should progress from the
simple to the complex as a crafter earns new skill levels. Instead of
experimentation points that (along with each experiment result) directly affect
the quality of the final product's attributes, what if experimentation points
determined how many connections the crafter could make between resources and
subcomponents? Novice crafters would find crafting to be simple because they'd
have few options for experimentation -- you pretty much just take whatever you
were able to assemble. Expert and Master crafters, on the other hand, would
have earned the experimentation points (and access to suitably complicated
schematics) to have the many options for experimenting among the resources/subcomponents
that would make crafting the surprising and <i>creative</i> experience it ought
to be.</span></p>

Handling the more advanced weapons would require more training, but you could

price -- novice and low-level crafters know they can't charge the same price

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a few
cases (but not all), attribute values for crafted subcomponents help determine
the final attribute values for the final product. (Resource attribute values
also matter, but the outcome of each assembly and experimentation step is the
main determinant of object attribute quality.) This association of inputs with
outputs is so useful that I'd like to see it expanded to many more objects. It
seems like a natural feature for a crafting system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>However,
it's not critical in and of itself. This is for two reasons I've mentioned

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Numeric
     attributes aren't the only feature of a product -- it also has visual and
     sonic characteristics, as well as potentially having alternate operational
     modes (the latter of which could arguably be more important than the
     numeric attributes of the basic operational mode). The characteristics
     (numeric and visual/sonic) of resources and subcomponents definitely do
     not play any kind of useful role in determining the non-numeric
     characteristics of most crafted objects -- but that's not a problem, it's
     an opportunity.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Being
     able to define the output characteristics of a crafted object (by choosing
     the inputs) is a necessary feature of a crafting system... but as I've
     tried to say, it's not the only thing that matters. You need it to be able
     to satisfy non-crafter players, and it's mildly interesting to figure out
     optimal inputs for a desired output, but ultimately that's just about
     being a cog in the economy, and not about having fun crafting. When all
     that matters is building the &quot;perfect&quot; T21, where's the
     opportunity for making interesting mistakes? Is there no value in anything
     unexpected? As long as crafting is designed solely to get from Point A to
     Point B to satisfy non-crafter consumers, as long as it's just about what
     crafters can make and not about crafters themselves, crafting will
     continue to fail to be as much fun as it could and should be.</span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Again,
though, while as I note above the association of inputs with outputs shouldn't
be the most important thing in a crafting system, it's still important. That
being the case, we might as well do it right, which means applying it to most
objects instead of the few objects that currently take the attributes of their

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well, I
would argue that it's been because servicing the combat-oriented players has
historically been considered more worthy of developer time and money. That
doesn't mean creating a truly interesting crafting system isn't something worth
doing on its own merits; it just means that combat features have been given the
higher priority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But of

they must continue to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I should
add here that I find it interesting that you reversed the order of the
suggestions as I originally made them. I had items 1, 2, and 3 ordered the way
I did for a reason: each improved crafting feature builds upon the previous
suggested feature. If you break up that order, well, of course the strength of
the overall proposal seems weakened!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Each of
the steps I suggested flows into the next. Step 1 is to modify objects so that
they have lots of features -- not just numeric characteristics, but things you
can see and hear and use. Crafters can't make such objects yet, but they can be
made (perhaps as loot). Once you've allowed for complex objects by implementing
step 1 (and seeing as best you can how they interoperate with the game's other
systems such as combat), <i>then</i> it becomes appropriate and useful to move
to step 2, which is to tie outputs to inputs, to strongly associate an object's
features with the features of the items that went into its construction. That
provides the fundamental structure for a &quot;deep&quot; crafting experience.
And once you've got that, then you can in step 3 expand on the system by which
you make these input/output associations. In this way the opportunity for
interesting (i.e., surprising) experimentation finally becomes possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First
step 1, then step 2, then step 3. Done in this order, you can achieve the goal

programming staff to do everything all at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Before

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First of
all, I don't think you can exclude the starter professions and wind up with an
accurate picture of who's crafting and who's not. If a third of SWG's players
are trying (or playing) Artisans and Medics, that's a pretty good-sized chunk
of the player base. Add in a few more percentage points for those who just take
the Engineering and Home Ec skill lines to get to Weaponsmith, Armorsmith,
Architect, Tailor, and Chef, and you're looking at even more players. Doctors
and Bio-Engineers add even more to the numbers. And if you consider Merchants
to be crafters (not unreasonable considering their close relationship to
crafting and the extension of their profession from the Artisan's Business
skill line), you're probably looking at half the player base directly affected
(to a greater or lesser degree, of course) by how crafting works.</span></p>

worth the effort.</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>
If the changes did make crafting more desirable and bring more crafters into
the game, does the game need more crafters? What would the impact of more
crafters be? o more goods o lower prices for goods o higher prices for
resources (individual resources are seen as more valuable because their
connection to the end product is more visible) o more desirable products --
look at the call for furniture coloring or the pilots trying to match blaster
fire patterns with weapons to get the neat effects when the weapons fire. o
increased draw and retention of players that care about the “wow” factor of the
environment -- These changes must be, by the nature of balance limits on things
like damage done from weapons, cosmetic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First,
I'm not convinced (yet) that better crafting = many more crafters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>More?
Well, I hope so, especially if that means more people giving SOE their money.
That translates into better survival value for SWG, which benefits all of us
who are still playing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But <i>many</i>
more? Doubtful. I look at players as people -- they have things they like
doing, and things they don't like doing. When they play a game, they extend
these likes and dislikes to game features. People who like being active and
experiencing things won't care whether SWG has a great crafting system or a
lousy one because they'll be too busy doing things that they enjoy more
(namely, combat). Meanwhile, those folks whose interests naturally tend to the
creative will gravitate immediately to crafting whether it's good or bad. Its
goodness or badness will determine whether they <i>stay</i>, but it's not a significant
factor in attracting new players. (I would admit that word of mouth is a
significant factor in attracting combat-oriented players to a game, but how
many Web sites or magazines are there that exist to highlight the non-lethal
features of games?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
said this, let's say you're right -- suppose the developers took all my
wonderful suggestions and made crafting in SWG more fun than being tickled with
$10,000 bills you got to keep afterwards. And let's further suppose that this
attracted a lot of new players. What then?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Would
more goods be created? Probably, which in addition to lower prices would mean
more choices for consumers. I doubt most of SWG's other players would consider
either of these to be Bad Things! As for crafters, they won't care unless
they're Merchants, since with a crafting system that's loads of fun in its own
right, you don't have to sell what you make in order to have fun. And as for
Merchants... well, they're clever devils; they can figure out some way to
profit from <i>anything</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Would
resource prices go up due to competition between crafters? Possibly, but not
inevitably, since starting crafters usually also pick up the Survey line and
can mine their own resources at no cost to anyone else. Furthermore, even if
competition did increase resource prices somewhat, it's unlikely that these
costs would rise to a level that would affect the pricing of crafted objects,
which is fairly inelastic -- prices of crafted objects are primarily based not
on resource cost but on perceived desirability. (This is somewhat less true for
the most advanced items like RIS armor that require rare components, but
desirability still determines pricing.) As a conversation over in the Business
and Economy forum noted, there's a pretty good cushion between most resource
costs and prices for items crafted using those resources. That means resource
costs could go up a reasonable amount and not meaningfully affect object costs.
So a lot of new crafters would probably not affect object pricing due to contention
for resources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As for
the enhanced desirability of products and an increased &quot;wow&quot; factor
due to more crafters using an improved crafting system... these don't seem like
things that would damage SWG in any way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
it's just a theory of mine but I believe that crafters tend to stay with an
online game longer than combat-oriented players. So if improving the crafting
system meant a larger proportion of crafters in the SWG player base, that
suggests to me that SWG has subscribers who'll stick around longer and keep
putting money in SOE's pocket. That would seem to mean better survival odds for
SWG, wouldn't it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>All told,
then, I don't come to the conclusion that improving the crafting system to make
it a more enjoyable process would not be worth the effort -- just the opposite,
in fact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The only
question I have is how to make the business case (more than has already been
made) that the changes I suggest are not just worth doing, but that they're
more worth doing than yet more features for the combat-oriented players after
nearly two years of rapt attention to their demands. As I've said before, I've
got nothing against combat-oriented players and I don't mind them getting cool
new combat features... but I do mind going for two years without equally cool
major features for non-combat players.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>I suspect SWG has decided those aren’t pressing enough
reasons to put out the effort this game. For future games – could they be
right? What kind of game could support this different balance? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's a
great question. I don't mean to be glib, but I think a reasonable answer is: a
better SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For one
thing, focusing even temporarily on improving the game for crafters would
create a &quot;deeper&quot; game, with more complex objects and more
interesting actions and interactions between players. The combat-oriented
player might not care directly about increased deepness, but it would affect
the game world in which he plays. I think most (perhaps not all, but most) of
those effects would be positive -- deep = less boring, and pretty much everyone
agrees that the worst sin any game can commit is to be boring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
another thing, a serious refocusing on crafters (even if only temporary) would
possibly attract more crafters. Given the way that players report likes and
dislikes to developers (or maybe I should say, given how developers hear what
they want to hear about what players like and dislike based on what they happen
to have developed for those players), a significant positive response from a
lot of crafters enjoying an improved crafting game could lead SWG's developers
to conclude that new crafting features are a relatively cheap way to get good
PR, and from that conclusion decide to maintain an interest in keeping crafters
happy along with combat-oriented players. I don't see how that would diminish
SWG for anyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
in my overall goal -- that crafting in SWG, while good, could be better if
reworked to focus more on the process of crafting itself than on the results of
crafting. But I'm not married to any of the specific suggestions I made at the
top of this thread to try to achieve that goal. Still, I felt that given such a
reasonable criticism of them, they deserved one good rebuttal. I hope this was
it!</span></p>

regulate the progress of a character's access through the game's varied

successful tabletop RPGs that have used other means by which to persuade
players to play. Maybe some day an online RPG developer will try one of these
alternatives, and we can finally start to break free of the tyranny of XP.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>A <i>real</i> crafting system would be difficult to
master, encourage dedication to the craft, and fair pricing for fair products,
and cater to the crafting geeks. The type of player that like to spend time
tinkering and learning. NOT every Tom, Richard (dern filters!) and Harry that
has a few extra SP.<br>
<br>
The real masters would be the people who actually took the time to master the
system and truely enjoyed that type of game play. Not wannabe's and leet dudes.
Let them go kill things (and each other) in great numbers.<br>
<br>
How's THAT for focusing on the process rather than the result???</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well, I
don't know about everyone else, but I like it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Actually,
I'm reminded of the examinations that were required for promotion in the old
Royal Navy, such as are described in C.S Forester's &quot;Horatio
Hornblower&quot; novels. You'd sit before three crusty old captains, who'd
grill you for hours on specific questions of ship handling and mastery of other
men. Only if you could satisfy them that you'd be able to do your duty -- even
while utterly alone for months on the other side of the world -- would you be
promoted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm not
suggesting that achieving mastery in SWG should work like that! But there's
still something fascinating about the idea of gaining access to increased power
by proving your ability to real experts, as opposed to mashing the same mouse
buttons over and over and over again for hours. (Or, even worse, letting a
macro do it for you... or buying a master character from eBay.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The thing
to recognize here is that crafting in SWG is utterly simple compared to the
number of things you have to know to successfully captain a ship of the line.
SWG's crafting system is better than that in most other games, we all agree on
that... but it's still extremely simple and limited. There just isn't much room
for innovation or creativity or surprise -- you just don't have to know that
much to master a crafting profession because crafting is mostly about mashing
buttons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now, if
crafting were enhanced to allow more options in experimentation, if actual
player creativity could somehow be permitted in the creation of objects and
processes so that player knowledge and skill actually mattered... now that
would be a game worth mastering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We hear
from time to time that PvP play and JtL play are supposed to measure the
player's skill, not just the character's acquired abilities. Shouldn't that
hold true for crafting, too?</span></p>
