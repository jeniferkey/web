<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2005/11/21</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
best of the single-player FPS games based on the Star Wars license, <i>Dark
Forces II: Jedi Knight</i>, there's a level in which you must find a way to
escape from a starship that is plummeting toward the ground.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's
terrifying fun: klaxons are howling; the deck pitches and cants at crazy angles
causing objects to fall past you and explode; a wrong step sends you falling to
your doom; it's hard to get your bearings; and through all of this there is a
timer inexorably counting down the seconds until the ship crashes and you must
restart the level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
how I feel about SWG. Except it's not as much fun. And I’m not seeing any
reason to restart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I came to
SWG about a year before it launched because it sounded so good. For one thing,
I'm a fan of the films. (I was quoted in my hometown newspaper for having seen
the original film seven times.) The idea of playing a MMOG based on the movies
that would let me &quot;live the saga&quot; sounded like a lot of fun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
another thing, I'm a student of game design, and like Timothy Burke I'm
interested in &quot;world-y&quot; designs in particular. What I saw and heard
from LucasArts and SOE suggested that SWG would indeed be a complex and dynamic
world, and that excited me as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So when
SWG launched, I signed off of EQ and started playing SWG. I also participated
frequently and constructively on the official forum. I've both praised and
criticized LEC/SOE developers, but I always tried to pay for my criticisms with
specific suggestions for correcting what I thought were problems, and I stuck
around through all the changes. All told, I think it's fair to say I've been
one of the &quot;loyalists.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>All of
which is to highlight the sense of betrayal I have increasingly felt, both as a
player of SWG and as someone who thinks that good design and implementation
matter. I don't use a word like &quot;betrayal&quot; lightly, as I'm not a
dramatic person; it's simply the most accurate word to describe my reaction to
the actions taken by SWG's developers since SWG launched, and most especially
regarding the recent &quot;New Gaming Experience.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
basically subscribe to everything Tim said (and said well), starting with his
praise of LEC/SOE for being willing to make broad changes to an existing game.
First, they admitted the obvious -- SWG wasn't delivering a &quot;Star
Wars-y&quot; experience. And then they proved ready to significantly alter the
game to achieve that goal. LEC producer Julio Torres and the other leads
deserve credit for these things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But this
by itself doesn't solve the whole problem. Seeing a problem and doing something
about it aren't enough -- you have to do the <i>right</i> things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where
LEC/SOE have repeatedly gone wrong IMO is the specific design and
implementation of the changes made to SWG's original design. The NGE is only
the latest example of two and a half years of increasingly bad design and
scheduling decisions. By itself, the NGE isn't enough to make me (a loyalist,
remember) give up on SWG. It's the fact that the NGE is the last and most
destructive wrecking ball applied to the remarkable original design of SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
feel &quot;betrayed&quot; just by the NGE -- I feel betrayed by the NGE on top
of two+ years of similar decisions that have consistently ignored, corrupted,
or outright eliminated the aspects of this game that I cared the most about:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG
     launched with and repeatedly pushed publishes containing bugs that were
     reported in testing. In some cases, these were bugs that had already been
     fixed in a previous release. A goal of hitting aggressive schedules is
     laudable, and the business need to release new content in time to tie in
     with other media events is understandable, but achieving good QA has been
     a consistent and conspicuous failure.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:3.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
     original design respected and encouraged multiple playstyles by explicitly
     requiring crafters, healers, and entertainers to support combatants.
     Subsequent releases provided serious content only for combatants; other
     playstyles received only minor content, or even had their required support
     abilities removed completely. The NGE delivered the final blow of this
     &quot;only combat matters&quot; thinking by its squashing of all
     entertaining and healing professions down to one class each, and all
     crafting professions down to one class (with four &quot;specializations&quot;
     so that it wouldn't be necessary to remove existing schematics)... but the
     combat professions received all six remaining classes of the nine primary
     classes. Not only that, but combat skills and non-combat skills do not
     trade on a one-to-one basis when existing characters are converted to one
     of the new classes. Knowing any skill in one of the pre-NGE non-combat
     professions inflates into knowing all possible non-combat skills in the
     sole related NGE class, but one pre-NGE combat skill is worth one NGE
     combat skill. Translation: combat skills are worth more. Taken as a whole,
     these changes on top of all the others have sent a clear message: SWG is
     only for people who like fighting games. Explorers and Socializers need
     not apply.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:3.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
     particular, the handling of Jedi has been consistently awful. You would
     think that a concept so fundamental to the story told in the movies would
     be handled with extreme care, from gameplay concepts to implementation to
     playtesting, but such seems not to have been the case. The initial idea of
     unlocking Jedi abilities through mastering several random professions made
     some sense from a game mechanics perspective: it would take time and
     effort; it would be unique to each player; it would reward and thereby
     promote a deep knowledge of the game. As a mechanical process, it got the
     job done. But in terms of actual entertainment value, it was a Very Bad
     Idea: it led to mindless grinding past professions that others valued; it
     bore no resemblance to how a simple moisture farmer could learn to respect
     and apply the Force; and it quickly began filling the game world with Jedi
     characters run by powergamers who had no interest in &quot;playing like
     Jedi.&quot; Subsequent changes never solved this problem. The NGE simply
     surrenders and calls it victory -- now anyone can be a Jedi when they
     start the game. That's not more &quot;Star Wars-y&quot; -- it's less, much
     less... and it's typical of how SWG's developers have sacrificed a deeply
     human story of betrayal and redemption to whatever Marketing says will
     move more SKUs.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:3.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
     easily-switchable skills system of the original design promoted variety in
     play, depth of roleplaying, and opportunity for experimenting with other
     playstyles. While these features offered open-ended gameplay, the cost was
     that effectively knowing and performing one's role in combat groups
     required study and experience. To make this goal easier, the Combat
     Upgrade stratified professions somewhat, reducing the value of having a
     broad set of skills. The NGE utterly destroyed the skills system, turning
     SWG into merely another class-bound MMORPG.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:3.0pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
     simplification of skills into a few classes is part of a larger trend of
     reducing or eliminating many of the deeper aspects of gameplay. As Tim
     noted, it is impossible not to wonder whether the depth of gameplay and
     even the keyboard control system are being &quot;dumbed-down&quot; in
     order to attract console gamers. (I'm not expressing a personal belief
     that console gamers are dumb. I'm describing what I believe is the
     perception of console gamers by SWG's current designers as incapable of
     appreciating any gameplay beyond rote memorization and trivially simple
     button-mashing.) [Note: SWG producers have explicitly said that they have
     no intentions of modifying SWG to support direct play by console owners.]</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
feel any personal animosity toward any of the responsible folks at LEC or SOE.
They mostly seem like nice people, and I'm sure that most if not all of them
want to make a fun game and truly believe that their decisions are the right
way to achieve that goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
problem is with the definition of &quot;fun&quot; that SWG's post-launch
development team seemed to have. The original design of SWG promised depth and
drama, things I care about in a game, but since SWG launched it has been
repeatedly stripped of those things in favor of simpleminded combat. This
doesn't mean that SWG has become a bad game, or that it couldn't once again
become a popular game. It just makes SWG a game that I can no longer enjoy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Will
Vanguard or D&amp;D Online or Lord of the Rings Online or Star Trek Online be
the game that proves that &quot;deep&quot; and &quot;popular&quot; aren't
mutually exclusive? Will any of them offer emotionally engaging entertainment
and retain that focus over time? Can LotRO or STO deliver fun gameplay while
remaining true to the spirit of their licenses (and satisfying their
licensors)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I hope
so. I just don't know yet if, after SWG, I'll be able to trust any MMOG
developer enough to try them out. That's perhaps not a purely academic
viewpoint, but I'm saying all this with my gamer’s hat on. I submit this as an
isolated sample of how one person can respond when significant changes are made
to an existing game.</span></p>
