<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2004/08/25</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here are
some ideas I've come up with for asteroid mining that I'd like to see included
in <i>Jump to Lightspeed</i> at some (relatively soon) point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I know
there are a number of objections to allowing asteroid mining in JtL (including
that the developers have said it won't be in the original release), so I've
tried to address most of these issues in the list below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Ten
big space sectors should offer plenty of room for mining. If there's at least
one asteroid field per sector, that's good; if there are multiple fields in
some sectors, that's better. If asteroid fields are also large enough to have
thousands of different-sized rocks, that's perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. It
might be desirable to limit the use of space resources to schematics for ships
and ship components. This would prevent people who buy the JtL expansion from
having an advantage over those who don't and who are thus restricted to the ground
game. Alternately, allow space resources to be used in all crafting -- what's
the point of an expansion if not to get people to buy it because it gives them
valuable new abilities?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. Limit
the impact of asteroid mining on the overall economy by requiring the use of
ships with specialized cargo holds (inventory containers) whose sole use is
carrying resources mined from asteroids. (If your ship is destroyed, you lose
some or all of whatever is in your cargo hold.) Two other ways to minimize the
economic impact of asteroid mining would be to make asteroid mining dangerous
(see item 4), and to cap the total number of resource units that can be
harvested (see item 12).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4. Space
should generally be somewhat dangerous, what with natural hazards, NPC pirates,
and factional NPCs (and possibly Space Monsters). The two &quot;badlands&quot;
sectors should be even more dangerous. Resource quality should tend to improve
with proximity to danger -- not 1:1, but often enough so that the risk vs.
reward relationship is reasonably strong. Note that this also helps limit the
impact of asteroid mining on the overall game economy by keeping the number of
miners low.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>5.
Require a &quot;mining rig&quot; to mine resources from asteroids. This is a
device that attaches to a ship in place of a weapon, modifying the appearance
of that ship appropriately. This will distinguish mining ships from
non-combatant ships (although pirates might look for ships with mining rigs!),
and would improve the game experience by requiring players to make interesting
choices between firepower and commercial abilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>6. An
even simpler approach might be to dispense with the mining rig concept
altogether and just let the player sample from the nearest asteroid. The player
would simply have to imagine that some kind of drilling rig is in use, but as
this is pretty much how the ground game works now (other than the
surveying/sampling animations), players are already used to it. The advantage
of this approach is that it eliminates the need for new art resources (the
mining rig image) to be created and programmed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>7. It
would be nice if asteroid mining generated a unique animation similar to
ground-based sampling/surveying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>8. Ships
have to attach themselves to an asteroid to be able to mine it. (I'd say let
ships land on asteroids, but that functionality is probably not in the initial
combat-specific edition of JtL. OTOH I see no reason why we can't expect to be
able to bump up against objects in space even in the initial release of JtL, so
a very primitive form of &quot;docking&quot; to asteroids for the purpose of
mining should be simple enough to implement. Naturally, there might be a bit of
math involved in making sure the player's ship remains tangential to the
asteroid's surface while taking on the 3-D motion elements of that asteroid and
its rotational motion. But of course programmers live for solving that kind of
challenge. )</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>9.
Requiring players to be present to mine resources from asteroids allows reuse
of the existing &quot;sampling&quot; UI, minimizing the new UI code that would
otherwise have to be written.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>10.
Minimize crowding by restricting individual asteroids to one miner at a time.
Alternately, base the number of active miners per asteroid on the size of that
asteroid (assuming the sizes of asteroids vary appropriately).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>11. To
keep things simple, give each asteroid its own random percentage for all
current space resources. Or if more &quot;realism&quot; is desired, calculate
resource percentages just like on the ground (except in 3-D) so that the
asteroids nearest the highest percentage location have the best percentages,
but others farther away have decreasing percentages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>12. As
yet another alternative, consider setting a total number of resource units for
each asteroid when new resources are spawned. Furthermore, let mining
operations on a particular asteroid actually &quot;use up&quot; all the
resources on that asteroid as they're mined. Rather than players sitting in the
same spot for days, you'd have miners constantly moving through asteroid fields,
which would be a lot more interesting. Running out of asteroids with
&quot;good&quot; resources shouldn't be a problem as long as space is full of
asteroids (compared to the number of miners) and resources shift often enough.
It would however still help limit the number of space-mined resources, thus
minimizing the impact of these resources on the overall game economy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>1. New ships would be added that have a mining capability.
I don't want to see Tie's and X-wings mining. What I think would be cool is
possibly a multi-player ship where you have a miner/pilot, and a gunner or two.
The gunners could be used to destroy smaller asteroids before they hit you, and
also to fight those pesky pirates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I think
you're right about this. I considered baldly stating that only multiplayer
ships (currently the SoroSuub yacht and the YT-1300) would be able to attach
mining rigs, but I wanted to try to include as many players as possible in
space mining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On
balance, though, I think I agree with you -- I don't want to see TIEs and
X-wings mining asteroids, either. Would limiting mining to multiplayer ships
(with or without the &quot;mining rig&quot; notion) work for you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>2. Possibly have a second type of mining ship that
launches limited used droids and then recollects them. Would be a nice addition
for DEs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
another idea I didn't go into much, but the idea of finding a way for droids to
play a useful and fun role in space mining would be of great value in helping
generate that &quot;Star Wars&quot; atmosphere. (Wait... space has no
atmosphere! Never mind.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
personally couldn't come up with a good idea for this off the top of my head as
I was putting together my initial list of ideas, so I didn't follow up on it.
But I like your idea of miner droids -- sort of like the seeker droids in ESB,
except that they can collect resources and return them to the calling player.
In conjunction with survey droids (would these be able to return info to you in
space), they could really add to the flavor of space mining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I also
like the limited-use aspect you proposed for these miner droids. DEs and other
professions need more consumables to sell beyond mere batteries -- why should
Artisans (powerups), Chefs (food/drinks), medical types (stims/medpacks), and
Smugglers (spices) have all the fun?</span></p>
