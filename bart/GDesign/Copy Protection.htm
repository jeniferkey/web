<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Copy Protection of
Games</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/02/01</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Copy
protection of games is a tough call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
one hand, as someone who's been paid for his writing, I'm a strong supporter of
copyright. And not just the letter of the laws and international conventions,
but the spirit of the rule that says you don't appropriate someone else's
property. In the first place, that's rude. In the second place, those who
create works for publication depend on the revenues of publication as incentives
to create. A culture that starts thinking it's OK to steal (to duplicate
copyrighted material without authorization) is a culture that's going to become
less creative, and that's bad for everyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
other hand, I have to agree that some of the actual measures taken to protect
works that are published in binary format are excessive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Take
Steam, for example. I suffered through Steam's nearly <i>FOUR HOUR</i>
installation/update process in order to play Half-Life 2. (Steam also forced
another online update two weeks later.) It was barely worth it. HL2 was a
superb game, in every way a great sequel to the wonderful original, but Steam
is such an abomination that it nearly outweighed the value of HL2. I consider
Steam to be invasive and intrusive; my impression is it treats consumers like
criminals. If Steam is a requirement to run some game then I will not buy that
game, period. (So long, <i>Pirates of the Burning Sea</i>.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm sorry
some jerk stole the source code to Half-Life 2 partway through the development
process, but punishing the many innocent gamers by imposing Steam's
heavy-handed copy protection monitoring on everyone is abusive. Bad developer!
Bad!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And Steam
is just a recent example. I'm old enough to remember the &quot;burn a hole in
the floppy disk&quot; copy protection scheme that frustrated valid purchasers
of software more than it defeated crackers. It was rude, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So I'm
stuck in the middle. I can see the motive behind creating a DVD technology that
formats and reads disks differently based on zones in order to reduce piracy,
but I can also see how this adds cost without being very effective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Similarly,
I can appreciate that game developers who've had to raise millions of dollars
in financing want to be reasonably confident that they'll earn back that money
through sales of their product, rather than losing income they deserve because
some people shared unauthorized copies of software. But I also resent very
intrusive copy protection technologies that treat everyone as guilty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Eventually
the most common content distribution model changed from floppies to CDs. After
we got through the first wave of publisher attempts to copy-protect CDs, most
game developers went to the model where you could install the code on a CD on
multiple machines, but required you to register the unique code for your CD if
you wanted support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
worked acceptably well for single-player games (although there was still some
digital shrinkage). Then came online, persistent-world games that offered
frequent content updates. Sending a CD every week or three would be too
expensive, so a digital download (since you're already online) made sense...
and there's the opportunity to do copy-protection again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This sort
of makes sense for online games. You might as well do online authentication for
online games when you already require digital downloading of new content. I'm
not happy about the sick download requirements for modem users, but I recognize
the inevitability of piggybacking authentication onto digital downloading.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My
question is, why try to retrofit this technology to single-player games (like
Half-Life2)? &quot;Because we can&quot; is not good enough. Steam and others of
its ilk are not appropriate for single-player games; they impose requirements
without offering value. They are abusive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So here's
my suggestion for a constructive alternative: unlockable content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The game
as shipped would need to be completely playable, and you could put it on as
many machines as you like (although you shouldn't). But if you're willing to
pay a little extra, you can go online and register your unique copy of the
game, and in return you'll get special downloadable content. New levels, new
monsters, new gear, new skins, enhanced textures -- any or all of these could
be made available to people who authenticate their copy of the game as unique.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's a
question of how you'd reregister if you buy a new computer and reinstall the
game on it. There would also be complaints of the &quot;You didn't sell me the
whole game!&quot; variety. But IMO these complaints would not prevent this
model from general acceptance by publishers and gamers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>After
all, it works in the online game world when it's called an
&quot;expansion,&quot; isn't it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Getting
the behavior you want by rewarding the law-abiding makes a lot more sense than
treating everyone like a criminal.</span></p>
