color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Ship hulls should range from those barely large enough to move one
living person all the way up to ISDs and beyond. There should be a selection of
different hull types to choose from, including: needle/wedge*, sphere, saucer*,
cylinder*, cone*, box, open frame, and irregular. (* indicates which hull types
are capable of operating in planetary atmospheres.) The size of a hull should
be proportional to its displacement in tons as well as to its cost (with some
minor tweaks per hull type).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Since SWG is space fantasy, rather than more &quot;realistic&quot;
science fiction, I expect that most if not all hulls will be either
needle/wedge (to land on planets). It might be nice to also have saucer and
sphere hull types available to provide some choices, however. (The droid
control ships from Ep. I were basically a saucer design... and as for spheres,
wouldn't the Death Star have had smaller prototypes? /evilgrin</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Typical power plants for starships in science fiction are fusion
reactors and antimatter, but apparently the main source of energy in starships
in the Star Wars universe is the ion drive itself. Not only does this provide
power for in-system flight (see the next section), it also supplies power to
the other two types of drive (repulsorlift and hyperdrive), as well as for all
other ship systems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Many sizes and power levels should be available when crafting (or
upgrading) ships in the Space Expansion, with price proportional to power
output (faster costs more) and inversely proportional to power plant size
(smaller costs more). The ion drive (the Databank notes) puts out a certain
amount of radiation, which could make working on active engines a hazardous
task for shipboard engineers!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>3. LOCOMOTION</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Ships in SW use at least two kinds of locomotion: in-system, and
interstellar. The in-system drive in SW is the sublight drive (of which the ion
engine is one common type), and the interstellar drive is the hyperspace drive.
Again, many types/sizes should be available. For example, the Hoersch-Kessel
ion engine must be available (after all, it's where TIE fighters get their name
-- Twin Ion Engine), but it would be helpful to have other kinds of sublight
drive available as well to offer more design options. It might also be fun if
the engines themselves were composed of subunits (that darn hyperdrive
motivator!), but that might be asking a bit much. As usual, with increased
power (for both normal space and hyperspace drives) the size and cost of
engines should increase as well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Note that if atmospheric flight is implemented, this should be
based on a third type of locomotion: the repulsorlift. (This is the antigravity
technology that landspeeders and swoops use.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>4. SENSORS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>They don't discuss this much in SW, but since you've got to be
able to &quot;see&quot; to navigate, it needs to be addressed. Types of sensors
provided should include: active electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) scanning (like
&quot;pinging&quot; in submarine movies except that much more detail is
provided), passive EMS scanning (ways to gain information about other ships or
objects without giving away your presence), mass detectors, particle detectors,
energy detectors, and computer systems that integrate all these sources into a
coherent picture of your surroundings. Many types of these instruments should
be available (at appropriate sizes and costs).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>The distinction between active and passive sensors is mostly
needed to support piracy, where it might be helpful/interesting to allow ships
to disguise themselves or hide behind objects. Wouldn't you like to be able to
make yourself look like a different (less dangerous) kind of ship? How about
hiding within some &quot;noisy&quot; space phenomena such as a solar corona, a
nebula, or the tail of a comet? If the SE won't be detailed enough to allow
disguising or hiding ships, then basic sensors (&quot;is it there?&quot;) will
be all that are necessary (if disappointing).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>One other reason to include better-than-basic sensors will be if
ECM/ECCM (&quot;sensor jamming&quot; in SW-speak) are included in the Space
Expansion. Dash Rendar's <i>Outrider</i>, for example, is a stock YT-2400 that
(according to the SW Databank) has been upgraded in numerous ways that include
&quot;a highly illegal and highly effective sensors countermeasure/stealth
package.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

color:black'>5. COMPUTERS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Again, this isn't discussed much in SW, but again, it's reasonable
to expect that they're required in a starship. One particular type of computer
that we know is necessary is a navigation computer (navicomp), but really there
should be computer capability distributed all over a starship. You'd want a
main computer for handling user interaction (queries to the galactic database
of objects, games like Dejarik, etc.), but pretty much every ship system should
have embedded computer control and communications with the other ships'
computers. These will allow control and status monitoring of ship subsystems
without having to route everything through the main computer. Think of the main
computer and many distributed computers as the brain and nervous system of a
starship. Capabilities should vary, and be priced accordingly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>6. BRIDGE &amp; CONTROL</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Well, you've got to control your ship somehow! The bridge (or
cockpit in a single-person ship) is the place on a ship to which all control
information flows, and from which all command instructions exit. You can get as
bare-bones as having nav sensors and a joystick and lift controls, or as fancy
as a a bridge crew of 20 staring at a 3-D holotank. Prices, of course, will
vary proportionally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>For a starfighter, controls should be fairly simple. Millions of
dollars have been spent trying to figure out the most sensible number and types
of controls and their layout in modern fighter jets, but one design principle
remains clear: simple is good. A complex arrangement may give you a high degree
of control, but it may also become too complex in the middle of a major
furball.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>For larger starships, the canon suggests that control and
monitoring functions are often split between multiple personnel. A small
freighter might break down operations into Piloting and Navigation/Avionics,
while a military vessel might have separate officers in charge of Piloting,
Navigation, Engineering, Sensors, Weapons, and Communications, and a full-size
military ships would include these officers, sub-officers, and numerous
deckhands to serve as crew. In all these cases, separate monitoring and control
activities should be routed to individual stations. (Note: I hope sitting down
to operate a station won't result in our buttsliding into the void of space.
That would be a Bad Thing.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>This might be counted as a key system, but I count it as support
since it won't be used all the time. Still, it's nice to be able to talk to
someone when you really need to -- comm hardware should vary by size, distance
capability, and cost. A related category is comm jamming equipment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>The MegaTraveller RPG suggests that certain &quot;channels&quot;
are available: ship ID (the &quot;black box&quot; transponder), hailing,
distress, landing and takeoff, tactical, etc. This concept is easily extended
to SWG and the Space Expansion, where &quot;channels&quot; for various purposes
already exist. The existing chat channel system should work pretty well for
this; we'd just create new channels for purposes as they come up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Some channels should probably be system-run persistent channels,
however. Maybe when your ship pops out of hyperspace near Lok you should be
able to open the planetary landing control channel (assuming Lok has one; not
every &quot;adventure planet&quot; should) for any system messages. Maybe
something like, &quot;Attention travellers: due to increased pirate activity,
the Imperial presence here on Lok has been stepped up for the duration of this
emergency.&quot; Or possibly message should be more applicable to gameplay:
maybe the landing control channel should give you specific instructions as to
where you can go to land your ship and how to do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>The Space Expansion might even allow you to fill up your ship with
cargo remotely. Instead of having to get out of your ship, walk to a Bazaar
terminal, buy stuff, carry it home with you under your arm, and only then store
it in your cargo hold, you should be able to activate the Sales channel to see
the local listing of Bazaar items, then buy whatever you want (at a higher
price than if you were using a Bazaar terminal) and have it
&quot;delivered&quot; to your ship (as long as your ship has enough
cargo/inventory space for it).</span></p>

color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>This system includes all the technologies needed to preserve life
and comfort in the vacuum of space. It features controls for: temperature,
atmosphere, light, humidity, and artificial gravity. But SWG doesn't require
any special handling of perishable or living items!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>For example, I've had several fish stuck in my bank vault for
eight months now and they show no signs of starting to stink. The various flora
in my private chemical and food crafting station have likewise been there for
months without degrading in any way. So we probably won't have to start
providing special environmental controls for living things or organic matter in
SWG just because of the Space Expansion. (Bit of a shame, really, as
&quot;decay&quot; of living items would be a way to reduce the number of
database objects that players could probably accept. I'm not saying they'd <i>like</i>
it -- just that they could live with it because it's realistic.)</span></p>

color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>It may not be necessary to buy and use fuel in the Space
Expansion. The &quot;realism&quot; would help generate a feeling of immersion
in the world, and it might make for an interesting component to the economy if
it's ever rare. But it could also be considered an annoying administrative
impediment to just getting out into space to duel other players. In other
words, having to have filling stations might be more trouble than it's worth.
Another hint that starship fuel might not be included is the fact that power
sources just aren't talked about much in Star Wars -- the Star Wars Databank
has nothing to say on the subject. Presumably power in Star Wars is so easily
and cheaply generated that it's just taken for granted that you can always have
as much as you want for free. If the Space Expansion is implemented this way it
would detract slightly from the &quot;science fiction&quot; feel of the game,
but the &quot;Star Wars&quot; feel won't be reduced much (if at all).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>If you think about it, security aboard a starship should always
favor the defender. With sufficiently advanced computers you can recognize
official crew and passengers and (since every access point has its own
computer) control where they can go. Uninvited &quot;guests&quot; could trigger
an intruder alert mode in which unfriendlies are led into passageways that are
then locked off... or perhaps into airlocks that get opened to space. Security
on larger vessels might also involve troops whose purpose is to repel boarders.</span></p>

place to store it. The two main issues here are how much space you need, and
what kind of environmental controls do you want for that space. Prices are
proportional to both of those. (For example, 500 cubic feet for shipping closed
containers of nonperishable items might run you CR10,000, while 10,000 cubic
feet for shipping live wampas and tauntauns might cost you CR200,000 (extra
space plus environmental controls). Additionally you might want a few special
compartments... these should be available, but at a considerable cost. This
system also controls cargo bay operations (doors, loading, unloading, etc.).</span></p>

explanation.)</span></p>

color:black'>In anything larger than a one-person ship, you'll probably need
berths for crew. Furthermore, if you're going to carry passengers, you'll need
staterooms. You might want a range of staterooms, with costs to match (see any
modern cruise liner's Web site for pictures showing how staterooms are laid
out). You might even want special environmental options for non-human
passengers... again, at a cost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Ship defenses seem to come in two flavors -- passive and active.
The typical passive defense is armor; more and stronger armor means not only
higher prices, but more mass to move (which should require larger engines,
which cost even more money). This should work like personal armor in the ground
game: condition points are taken primarily from armor, but a sufficiently
powerful attack may cause &quot;internal&quot; damage. In ships, this would
take the form of a reduction in the condition points of subsystems like engines
and weapons. You might also lose hull condition points (assuming those are
tracked separately).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Active defenses can take a number of different forms. In SW, the
classic active defense is deflector shields (not available on the original TIE
fighter, of course), which should be available in different strengths and
recharge times at different prices. The Star Wars Databank notes that shields
come in two types: ray shielding and particle shielding. (This is probably
another way of saying &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;kinetic&quot; shielding.)
Ships, with their smaller power sources, typically generate several small
shields in &quot;arcs&quot; around the ship; this allows the efficient use of
shield power since it can be directed away from where it's not needed to where
it's desperately needed. Other types of shield generators include personal
shield generators (as found in SWG) and Gungan energy bubbles, and large,
ground-based deflector shield generators, which are powerful enough to protect
entire installations or even large orbital objects.</span></p>

color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Ah, the fun stuff. First of all, ships should use the &quot;hardpoint&quot;
system to determine where and how many weapons may be attached structurally.
Examples of ship-mounted weapons in SW that we know of (we can always make up
more!) are ion cannons, light blaster cannons, turbolasers, and various missile
and torpedo launchers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>Mines, such as the ones Jango Fett deployed in the Genosian
asteroid field in AOTC, could also be interesting weapons. If implemented,
actuation modes could include contact, proximity, magnetic, and signal. (A
contact mine detonates on contact; a proximity mine detonates when any
appropriately-sized mass field gets close enough; a magnetic mine detonates
when a metallic object gets close enough; and a signal mine detonates when it
receives some number (1 or more) of external commands, either from a
character-controlled key or from a command mine.) Detonation modes could
include explosive, concussion, nuclear, and command. (An explosive mine just
blows up with a standard destructive charge; a concussion mine produces a
concussive wave; a nuclear mine produces a &quot;dirty&quot; radioactive
explosion; and a command mine sends a signal to other mines that it's been
activated.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'>(A note on command mines and mines with signal actuation systems:
These are used together to create minefields into which ships can travel some
distance before other mines explode. A signal-actuated mine can be set to
require several signals before it detonates -- you could even have a
signal-actuated mine that in turn detonates as a command mine to other
signal-actuated mines. A ship entering this kind of minefield would pass
through a first line of command mines; as it gets into the middle of the field
it kicks off more and more signals until the &quot;magic number&quot; is met,
at which point the entire field detonates. <i>Very</i> nasty.)</span></p>
