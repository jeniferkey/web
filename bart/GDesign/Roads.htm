<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Roads
should not be considered some mere &quot;nice to have&quot; feature appealing
only to a few players who keep asking for &quot;immersion.&quot; Roads are
important to creating memorable game experiences because they serve double duty
as both a storytelling and a gameplaying device.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
concept of The Road -- and of Home, beyond which lies adventure and toward
which one will find peace at the end of journeying -- is one of the most
enduing concepts in all of human literature because it is symbolic of all
journeys. Homer sent Odysseus out on the sea-road (as the Vikings called it)
2500 years ago in <i>The Odyssey</i> because that was how to make interesting
things happen to Odysseus as he tried to return home after the fall of Troy.
When Chaucer looked for a setting that would cause a group of very different
people to interact, he set them on a road in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Roads are
still crucial to modern literature as well. When Tolkien wanted to tell a tale
about how a simple person could accomplish great things, he set Bilbo Baggins
on the road out of the Shire in <i>The Hobbit</i>... and then sent Frodo down
even greater roads in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Tolkien even has Bilbo
singing a song called &quot;The Road Goes Ever On.&quot; And as Frodo remarks
wistfully, &quot;Sam, remember what old Bilbo said, 'You have to watch
yourself, Frodo. Once you've stepped out onto the Road, there’s no telling
where your feet will lead you!'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As new
forms of literature, MMORPGs such as EverQuest benefit from having roads or
paths that are safer than the surrounding areas that are &quot;off the beaten
track.&quot; This is important in both a story-telling sense (because
journeying farther from home by taking roads to far-away places is the outer
journey that mirrors the character's inner journey of personal change) and a
gameplay sense (because players know they can find adventure by stepping off
the safe road and traveling into the deep, dark forest).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Whether
implemented for roleplaying or for pure gaming, roads are invitations to
adventure!</span></p>
