going to rethink what Jedi do, we need to spend a little time thinking about
who Jedi are. What is it about Jedi that really makes them distinct from

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There is
a simple and well-known two word sentence that tells you everything you need to
know about Jedi: &quot;Power corrupts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Power is
seductive; when you have it, you want more. For some people, power changes from
being a means to some end to being an end in and of itself. Instead of using
power to achieve a goal, power is used to gain more power. When this happens,
the person or institution wielding that power has become corrupt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What
makes this corruption so seductive is that it's always so easy to rationalize
the quest for more power. &quot;Well, if [a dictatorship] works....&quot;
&quot;Join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some
people are able to resist this temptation. For whatever reason, some people are
so constituted as to recognize the importance of limits to individual power,
and to voluntarily impose those limits on themselves, even at those times when
greater power is most desirable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
world of Star Wars, both these elements of power and choice are always present
for a Jedi. Training in the Force confers ever greater power on a person, but
with that power comes the responsibility of choice -- not merely of when and
how to use the power of the Force, but the more difficult choice of when not to
use it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Those who
choose restraint when temptation beckons remain Jedi. Those who yield take
their first step down the path to the Dark Side. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ultimately,
being a Jedi is quite simple. The lessons take many forms, and can be painfully
hard to learn, but in the end there are only two lessons. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The first
and easier lesson is how to use the Force. The second and vastly more difficult
lesson is when to use the Force. When you're a Jedi, every situation is an
opportunity -- and a challenge -- to learn these two lessons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Progression
through the ranks of the Jedi is based on the student's demonstration of
ability and understanding of these two lessons. Much attention is given to
learning Force abilities and improving in their use. This obvious manifestation
of the Force is what most people see, and what most Jedi novices focus on (since
without ability there's nothing to control). But as a Jedi advances, he must
begin to show restraint in the use of the Force and demonstrate that he
understands why this restraint is necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The Jedi
trials are designed to test the Jedi's mastery of these two aspects of the use
of the Force. Within each level, a Jedi is expected to learn and demonstrate
ability in a defined set of skills. When the learner's teacher feels the
student has advanced sufficiently to earn the next rank, a mastery test will be
administered in which the student's understanding of when to use the Force is
assessed along with proficiency. Students who fail to demonstrate a proper
understanding of when and why to limit one's use of power, or who fail key
proficiency tests, will not be advanced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Bearing
the above in mind, there are two sets of features that need to be implemented.
One is the system of Jedi powers; this is already in the game and looks OK, so
no need to change this. The other necessary feature is the set of trials
designed to test the student's understanding of the proper use of Jedi powers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The first
item -- Force powers -- has already been implemented. But when to actually use
these powers should also be considered when generating answers to the list of
developer questions about Jedi.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
A Jedi goes wherever she's needed in the service of freedom. (Or, in the case
of Dark Jedi, in the service of order through force.) In other words, there's
no such thing as a &quot;typical&quot; Jedi interaction. Jedi must speak and
work with people from all walks of life, from the high to the low, from
warriors to scholars to crafters to entertainers, from kings to farmers and all
points in between -- whatever it takes to accomplish their mission.</span></p>

quests and trial ideas</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'><br>
Typically a Jedi trial is a requirement for the student to confront some
menace. In most cases this menace should take some external form that mirrors
the student's greatest internal temptation. This will test the student's
readiness to responsibly use the greater powers granted at the next level of
mastery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Within
SWG, some of a player's typical behaviors should be recorded, then analyzed
when a trial is needed. If a player has a habit of attacking anything and
everything with his lightsaber no matter what his surroundings, the quest might
be to locate and eliminate a monster threatening some villagers... except that
the &quot;monster&quot; is actually just the manifested dreams of one of the
village's children, and destroying the monster by whipping out one's lightsaber
will cause the student to fail the test. (The correct answer would be to use
Force Awareness to locate the true source of the disturbance, then use the appropriate
non-combat Force power to solve the real problem.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Similarly,
a player whose typical reaction is to run from perceived danger might be
required to risk death by actually battling a real monster. A player whose
dedication to the Light side is to be tested should be required to refrain from
use of the Force rescue friends or even to save her own life; a Dark side
player would fail a test by showing mercy to a weaker opponent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In all
cases the test of Force understanding will take the form most likely to require
the student to act against his nature (as determined by monitoring what the
player typically does). Only when the student can control himself can he be
trusted to control his use of the power of the Force.</span></p>

</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The usual lot:
Force Awareness, Force Push, Force Pull, Force Speed, Force Heal, Force
Reflection, Force Grip, Force Absorb, and Force Lightning are the ones that

I don't think there <i>should</i> be different quests based on a player's other
professions. Different types of quests for different types of other players are
fine, but they should all be thought of and structured to be Jedi quests.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

like to see four separate lines (disciplines?) through the Jedi skills -- maybe
Offensive (Grip, Lightning), Defensive (Reflection, Absorb), Manipulation
(Push, Pull, Speed), and Sensitivity (Awareness, Healing). Each discipline
would have its own trainee titles for each the four levels -- for example, the
titles of the Sensitivity discipline (beyond the &quot;Force Sensitive&quot;
novice skill box) might be:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
possibility would be to restrict Force users from advancing more than one level
above any existing level. That is, you wouldn't be able to learn a Level Two
skill until you'd learned all four Level One skills. Additionally, once all
Level One skills are learned it would be necessary to pass the appropriate
trial to open up the Level Two skill boxes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In this
case, progression through the skill tree would be keyed to the well-known level
titles (plus a new title for level 2):</span></p>
