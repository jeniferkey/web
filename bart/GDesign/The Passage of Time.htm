<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/06/23</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>June 23,
A.D. 2006</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2453910.41502
Julian</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2nd day
of summer 2006, northern hemisphere, Earth</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's
consider the question of how time passes (or not) in online worlds. It takes us
into multiple game systems, and winds up having some deep connections to how
different people experience a game world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The first
question that has to be asked is, should time pass at all?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's not
a requirement for a game. You could simply make time in the game an eternal
&quot;now,&quot; and eliminate all questions related to the passage of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For some
game worlds, that might be desirable. Social worlds, for example, probably
don't need to create their own local time format. It's also possible to imagine
game worlds that are more like tone poems; they're not about gameplay so much
as experiencing a particular feeling or event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's when
we consider larger and more complex game worlds in which players can, to some
degree, tell their own stories that marking time in the game world becomes useful.
For these worlds that try to balance gameplay and immersiveness, the next
question is whether time should pass with reference to physical or social
phenomena (or both).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Examples
of physical phenomena related to time are things like the day/night cycle,
circadian rhythms, tides, seasons (temperature, weather), erosion, plant and
animal responses to long-term temperature changes (look up the &quot;Maunder
Minimum&quot;), and continental drift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And
examples of social phenomena related to time are interest on loans, labor
organization, traffic patterns, housing styles, city growth, and migration
routes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To
explore these possibilities for features in a gameworld, let's look at the most
common ways in which time is measured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Seconds</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
measurement of seconds only gains importance when you can measure them
accurately. That means you need the ability to build clocks/watches. So does
the technology in your game (whether mechanical or magical) support that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And from
a game perspective, do players need to know exactly what second something
happened or will happen?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Minutes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>See
&quot;seconds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Hours</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Hours are
primarily a social measure of time. As civilizations become more complex, they
tend to develop labor specializations. To support people of different professions
working together, it's useful to be able to coordinate times at which exchanges
can be made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is this
really necessary in your game? Is there gameplay value in players knowing
exactly what hour (within some larger measure of time, usually a day) it is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Days</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is your
game set in a location on a planet that rotates near a star, revolves around
that star, and whose rotation period does not match its revolution period? If
so, then logically it would have a day/night cycle. (Some orbital bodies are
what's called &quot;tidally-locked&quot; -- from the perspective of someone on
the body they revolve around, such a satellite always presents basically the
same face. Our Moon is like that.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And do
you want to spend time developing the graphics and code to dynamically change
both the ambient lighting and the sky textures?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If both
of these conditions are true, if you implement a day/night cycle, then you'll
probably want to define the &quot;day&quot; of your game to be shorter than a
real-world day. All of the MMORPGs I know of with day/night cycles do this; it
just seems to be perceived as more fun by most players -- probably a function
of variety/novelty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Weeks</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
socially-generated measure of time that your game probably doesn't need.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Months</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Yet
another primarily social measure of time. Because months are usually named,
they're potentially interesting as lore flavoring if your game also implements
days and years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Seasons</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Seasons
-- cyclically recurring periods of global temperature and weather variation --
are sometimes thought to be caused by a planet's orbit being elliptical, but
that's not correct... at least not for Earth, whose orbit is not very
elliptical. (A planet in a more elliptical orbit, such as Mars, does have
orbitally-induced seasons.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Earth's
seasons are caused by its axis being tilted (rather than perpendicular) with
respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. Because of its tilt and
average distance from the Sun, both of the northern and southern hemispheres
get roughly four seasons. (Except for Minnesota, which has only two seasons:
Winter and Construction.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So if you
set your game world on a planet, is that planet tilted on its axis? And will
you implement weather in your game?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If so,
then it's conceivable that weather patterns could change over the year
according to seasons. Knowing when a season was about to start was incredibly
important when survival depended on predicting when the local delta would
flood. That permitted sufficient crops to be irrigated to feed a growing city.
But as technology improved, and agriculture became less critical, seasons
became mostly a mildly interesting way to break up the passage of a year --
basically they allow some variation in the local weather.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So are
seasons worth the development time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To put it
another way: If weather is implemented at all in your game, will it have any
practical effect? Or will it just be pretty?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If it has
some actual effect, then seasons might be worthwhile. Otherwise, probably not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Years</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
period of a planetary body's revolution around a star is its year. It's a good
measure of the passage of time compared to a human's lifespan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If
characters in your game are effectively immortal, years might not be worth
implementing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On the
other hand, if nothing else ever changes cyclically in the game, then there's
no real downside to implementing years as an accumulation of some number of
days (other than the time to write and maintain the code). If players can know
that they started playing in the year 3371 and it's now the year 3402, what are
the benefits of that, and do they outweigh the cost in terms of the time it
took to code that capability?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What
about if instead of numbering years, you named them (as in the &quot;Year of
the Fruit Bat&quot;)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Decades
and Longer Periods</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It would
be fascinating to see an online game world that tried to deepen its
immersiveness by reflecting some of the phenomena related to multi-year spans
of time. These could be physical, such as changes in tree types or animal
migrations; or they could be social, as in organizing periods of years
according to who's in charge politically (&quot;the 12th year of the glorious
reign of Planodigitus Maximus&quot;).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Perhaps
someone will give this kind of thing a shot someday.</span></p>
