<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Note: In
what follows, be aware that we're talking about crafted products -- that is,
we're only talking about the stuff that crafters have permanent schematics for
and can make at will if they have the resources. Sales of loot, quest, and
one-off schematic items do participate in the SWG economy but don't determine its
form.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To begin
with, let's be aware of the fundamentals. SWG's economy is a near-textbook
example of what economists call &quot;perfect competition.&quot; By definition,
this is a market structure in which:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Products
     are relatively undifferentiated (i.e., they lack &quot;diversity&quot;).</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Price
     and quality information is readily available for all products.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
     are many buyers and sellers.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>New
     sellers can easily enter the industry.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Every one
of these is true for SWG. This means that SWG's economy should show many of the
effects -- both good and bad -- that models of perfect competition tell us to
expect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a
perfect competition economy there are numerous producers of a few similar
(undifferentiated) goods, and many buyers who do not coordinate on what prices
they will pay. This should generate intense competition on price, since --
because there are numerous producers, and few other ways to differentiate goods
except on price -- we should expect that no one producer or consumer should be
able to leverage their size to set prices. Supply and demand will dictate the
average price of every item.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And
that's exactly what we find in SWG: lots of similar items at similar prices.
(With a few oddballs from people who aren't serious sellers.) In a monopoly or
oligopoly, one or a few sellers can set prices and everyone else has to follow;
in the perfect competition of SWG, if one seller doubles his price, he loses
sales because nothing prevents other sellers from offering the same item at a
lower price.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
situation isn't entirely a bad thing... if you're a consumer. Perfect
competition such as SWG's is good for consumers in at least three ways: 1) it
tends over time to depress prices to their lowest possible level; 2) it allows
new players to compete in an established market, which insures a constant
supply of price-competitive goods, and 3) it encourages producers to try to
make the highest quality items (in order to try to compete on something other
than price). If you're a buyer, you have to love perfect competition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But along
with the good, SWG also shares the negative effects of perfect competition. In
particular, it makes life hard for producers, and in the exact opposite ways in
which it's good for consumers: 1) it limits profits (because you can only chase
sales by lowering your prices); 2) it discourages success through innovation
(because experienced players can't leverage that experience to create new kinds
of goods); and 3) it raises costs (by limiting the resources that can be used
and requiring that lots of time be spent in finding and harvesting the
&quot;best&quot; resources).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
result is that SWG's economy is extremely customer-driven: If nobody wants it,
there's no point in making it. This is great for you if you're a combat player,
as there'll always be weapons and armor for you at some price, but it takes a
lot of the fun out of being a crafter because it basically makes us indentured
servants. (Which may be exactly the balance of power that SWG's designers
want... but that's another thread.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So, all
this said, it seems to me that the real question is whether it's possible to
make the crafting game more fun for crafters without significantly affecting
the perfect competition model that makes SWG's economy so consumer-friendly,
and if so, how that could/should be done.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ultimately
it comes down to allowing crafters to differentiate their products. The tricky
thing about allowing differentiation us that it can move an economy away from
perfect competition toward what's called &quot;monopolistic competition&quot;:
those who are able to make a unique product are able to set the price for that
product, so that price may not be a good reflection of actual value. An example
of this in SWG would be if I somehow figured out a way to make T21 rifles that
did both heat and electrical elemental damage -- as the only producer of such
items in a market of many buyers, I could effectively set whatever price I
wanted and people would still buy as many as I could make, even though it
wouldn't be that much better than a regular T21. (To be more precise, this
would actually be a monopoly situation. If I taught a few other people on my
server how to make such rifles, then we'd have monopolistic competition. The
effect is roughly the same.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So
obviously that's a dangerous road to travel, no matter how much fun it might be
for crafters-as-sellers to be able to differentiate their products on something
other than price.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But I
think there may be a solution. It's twofold:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First,
enhance the crafting process to allow crafters some way to differentiate their
products on features... but design this new process so that every advantageous
new feature comes at the price of a disadvantage. For every benefit, let there
be a corresponding and equivalent cost. (Note that you could also allow features
that have no benefit -- things like colors and shapes that don't affect
utility. These would also help differentiate products, but as they're purely
aesthetic they would not need to be countered with a &quot;cost&quot; feature.)
I described such a concept in my Crafting: A Blueprint for the Future thread,
but there are certainly other approaches possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Second,
expand the idea of crafting specializations. Currently, any crafter can
experiment on whatever attributes are experimentable for any item, but some
crafters have more experimentation points than others (humans, for example,
which I personally find annoying since that's supposed to be a Mon Calamari
species benefit, but never mind). What if this were expanded? Maybe a crafter
who learns a particular ranged weapon skill from the Marksman profession gains
an additional point of experimentation when crafting a ranged weapon. Maybe
learning a Commando skill gives an additional point for experimenting on
minimum/maximum damage, while learning a Ranger skill gives an additional point
when experimenting on weapon speed. Maybe there's a crafting quest item you can
install (permanently) in your datapad that gives a 10% bonus to weapon
experimentation but that also imposes a 20% penalty on all Artisan experimentation.
And so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Between
these two changes, crafters would become able to create items that varied on
both features and quality, but without allowing any one crafter to
automatically become the &quot;best&quot; (and therefore able to dictate
pricing). And this would happen because different crafters would make different
choices, because these choices would not be better or worse but just different,
and because not everyone could make everything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There'd
still be some overachievers who'd feel they had to provide hundreds of every
possible combination... but if any individual item could have five or ten or
twenty possible combinations, there's no way any one crafter could sell every
possible kind of item -- no would merchants remain sane from all the restocking
of their vendors they'd have to do. Big PAs that have multiple specialized
crafters selling stuff in a mall could come close, but there's no real
difference between that and what we have right now, is there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As far as
I can see, the bottom line of implementing these changes is that consumers
would get more choice, crafters would have more fun (because the process of
crafting would be more interesting), and prices would remain low due to supply
and demand forces on different but equivalent goods. Everybody wins, and
fiddling with resource amounts or types is not necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Update:
the I don't like vendor search from bazaars thread over on the Merchant board
has a message from DocSavag (toward the end of the first page) saying
(concisely) exactly what I was trying to say here. When there are so many
options that no one can hope to be able to make everything, specialization
becomes possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I would
only add that this will tend to raise prices, however, unless alternate
products are basically each as good as the other so that no one crafter can
monopolize the market for that product.</span></p>

I've committed some errors of vision or implementation in this proposal; any
&quot;grand design&quot; concept is always imperfect. If so, please feel free
to point out how you think this idea could be improved, or offer a different
idea you think would be more effective.</span></p>
