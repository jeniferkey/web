1</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/21</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why do we
need character levels in MMOGs? The main reason seems to be a belief that
characters must &quot;grow&quot; in MMOGs. Level mechanisms are then
implemented to achieve that goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But where's
the evidence that all characters in MMOGs must somehow advance in power? It's a
common belief, but are there good reasons why that belief is so commonly
implemented? Or do most games only have it because most other games have it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Character-growth
games, with their emphasis on &quot;high-end&quot; content, send the message
that you can't access the really fun content until you've maxed out your
character's levels. This causes players to grind for XP in order to reach the
highest level as quickly as possible. Instead of having fun playing a game,
players must work to reach a point where they can (eventually) start having fun
playing a game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Does that
sound like fun to you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It
doesn't sound very entertaining to me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What if
you didn't have to worry about how players levelled up because there were no
levels? You could still have skills; you could even have different levels of
particular skills -- they'd just all be learned during character creation.
Instead of trying to find way to minimize grind time to level up as rapidly as
possible, players would be free to spend their play time enjoying using the
skills they gave their characters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I like
this approach because it's oriented more toward exploration than achievement.
But the fact that I personally like it may not be the best measure of the value
of an idea. So it's probably a good idea to think about the likely objections
to designing a MMOG that's not wrapped around the idea of character growth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here are
some of the problems I'd heard people perceive with the &quot;no character
growth&quot; design, and my responses to those objections:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1.
Players are used to progression-based games, and will reject a
no-character-growth game as too different.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This one
could be true of many who currently play MMOGs... but who says a game has to
focus on attracting only current players?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don't
even know that the assertion in the objection is true. How do we know that
enough players won't adopt a different kind of game to make that game viable?
Remember that once upon a time there were no MMORPGs at all -- a lot of
tabletop RPG players managed to make that transition. Personally, I suspect
that the only people convinced that &quot;players don't like change&quot; are
the publishers who want players to stay locked into genres that they (the
publishers) think they have a big market share of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Overall,
I don't believe there's enough hard evidence on either side to decide this one.
The best way to find out if this objection holds true or not is to test it with
a few otherwise well-designed no-character-growth games and see how they do. If
we build several of them and no one comes, then OK -- it's back to character
growth games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Until the
next revolution in MMOGs, of course. :-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. Without
levelling up to occupy their time, players will focus even more than they do
now on burning through content, so a no-character-growth game will have to
provide a lot more content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
objection is probably valid. The only way I can answer is to say: OK -- so
provide more content than the usual character-growth game. If you're going to
have an exploration game (as opposed to a collectible/achievement-oriented
character growth game), then there had better be plenty to explore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Best bet:
Create large worlds (if fantasy) or large galaxies (if SF), then manage the
expansion rate by limiting the top travel speed and not resupplying characters
who go too far beyond the current frontier (sort of like the old tabletop
wargame concept of units losing quality when they go out of supply).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
problem of providing plenty of content is a real one, and I don't want to sound
like I'm brushing it off. I'm not. But I do think it's a more manageable
problem than some people think, as long as we're willing to do some hard
thinking about what we mean by &quot;content.&quot; If you think content only
means loot and levelling up, then you might as well just make yet another
character growth game. If you're willing to see content less as
&quot;stuff&quot; and more as &quot;experiences,&quot; then your game design
options become a lot more open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. Not
letting characters grow impedes the growth of the players who run those
characters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is a
concern that Richard Bartle in particular has expressed. One of Richard's
beliefs is that players grow as real people by playing characters. Through the
act of being someone else, they learn about themselves; as they learn, they
grow. Through this process, players slowly become more like the characters they
play, and their characters become more like their players. Eventually there's
no real distinction between the two; for Richard, this player has completed his
or her Hero's Journey. (This is my very brief restatement of Richard's
position; if you're at all interested in it you must read Richard's book <i>Designing
Virtual Worlds</i> to get this argument in his own words.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To some
people (probably those more interested in virtual worlds as games to be played
than as places in which experiences can happen), this will sound like a silly
argument. I don't agree; I think it's a dead serious argument. In the end, how
we behave as human beings is the only thing that matters. The way that these
game worlds help people engage in that process of becoming full humans makes
them important, and makes this question of player-growth-through-character-growth
worth considering respectfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
said, while Richard may be correct that players can grow by playing characters
(and I believe they can), I'm not sure he'd agree that character growth is necessary
for player growth. The key is not whether some arbitrary system for levelling
up is implemented -- what matters is that players can have a wide range of
experiences (through their characters) that illuminate their values. In that
case, a game design that rewards players for engaging in different kinds of
gameplay could be just as effective for helping players grow as persons as a
game design that rewards players for scaling an artificially constructed ladder
of character levels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm not
saying I think KOTOR should be used as a values education tool, but I do think
it's a good example of how &quot;character growth&quot; can be about more than
just gaining power, and can still be a lot of fun.</span></p>
