<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It’s
funny how so many people said things about SWG like, &quot;the initial
framework was great, they just didn’t build on [X].&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I tend to
agree… but what does that mean? What &quot;framework&quot; decisions were good,
and why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In rough
order of importance, here are some of the original design decisions I think
were most valuable to SWG, but which after their initial implementation weren't
(IMO) followed up on sufficiently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Are you
kidding? It's a license to use all the characters and places and music and
ideas from Star Wars! LucasArts and SOE would've been nuts not to make a MMOG
out of Star Wars. An obvious application was iconic characters as NPCs, but the
places in the various Star Wars movies (nearly characters in themselves) were
beautifully rendered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Iconic
characters were never fully exploited. Those who were implemented were passive;
they just sort of hung around and offered missions. What a waste! Matters have
improved slightly, but by no means enough -- iconic characters, given their
criticality to the popularity of Star Wars, ought to be flying madly around the
galaxy, exhorting players to take part in Star Wars adventures on every planet
in SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An
ability progression system based on skills was a novel change from the old
D&amp;D-based cookie-cutter class/level system. A skills-based system would
allow players to create unique identities from a widely-varied mix of
abilities, which would help players achieve a sense of identity in the game
world. This would also increase replayability by making it relatively easy for
players to try out new abilities. The inclusion of the need for Apprentice XP
to master a profession fit in with Luke's apprenticeship to Yoda, and offered
an opportunity to encourage players to interact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Failures</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
wildly mixable abilities made it hard to know what role you should play when
grouped (something the class system made simple). With the CU, roles became
more obvious, but at great cost: along with treating professions as classes we
also got levels, and the well-rounded &quot;jack-of-all-trades&quot; player
that SWG could have encouraged is now severely penalized. Instead of finding a
way to build on the strengths of the skills-based approach to help players form
groups, the CU's designers treated abilities-as-skills as a liability and
neutered it into just another class system. As for the Apprentice XP system,
although it added an interesting wrinkle to advancement, as the player base
shrank, finding someone who could train you became increasingly more
frustrating. Eventually AXP had to be eliminated entirely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Successes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In another
break from cookie-cutter MMOGs, SWG offered a fully player-run economy. Instead
of NPC vendors creating goods out of thin air and buying player-made goods with
money also made out of thin air, the vast majority of in-game items would be
crafted by players for other players. To support this, an astonishingly strong
player crafting system was implemented.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Failures</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
initial system implemented was so good that it was left relatively unenhanced,
as though no one recognized its importance to gameplay (or as a distinctively
marketable feature in the MMOG industry) by promoting it with significant new
functionality. There was never enough support given to players who wanted to
explore this system as advanced traders. Worse, crafting was regarded as a mere
support act, rather than as a marketable gameplay style that should be fun to
do in and of itself. Thus, crafting and trading languished while other gameplay
(combat) received major new features.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Again, pretty
much a no-brainer -- if SWG allowed players to become Jedi, people would pay to
play SWG. The structure of a Jedi's life, the rules governing a Jedi's conduct,
would make for fantastic roleplaying. And who wouldn't want to take down
enemies with a lightsaber?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Given
that there’s never been an explanation offered for the decision to base opening
the Jedi character slot on mastering four random professions, this seems to
have been a very bad idea from the start. It remains incomprehensible how
anyone could have thought that this mechanism for gaining Jedi status would be
acceptable to players. People will always complain because something is hard to
do, but requiring players to master a massive proportion of professions in
which they were completely uninterested (to get the four professions randomly
assigned) went beyond &quot;hard&quot;; this was closer to &quot;insane.&quot;
In addition to being a not-fun gameplay mechanism, it also had no apparent
connection to how the movies portrayed the acquisition of Force abilities. The
Jedi Revamp tried to replace this system with one based on fulfilling quests,
which was an improvement (and a welcome attempt to implement a system requested
by the user community), but has proven to rely excessively on grinding out XP for
advancement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the ways in which content would be freshened was through its use by
&quot;Digiteers.&quot; These would be LucasArts or SOE personnel acting as
iconic or other characters to create real-time, live scenarios that regular
players could see (and perhaps even participate in). Although this was not a
new idea (the earliest MUDs were run by &quot;wizards&quot; who would intervene
in the game world), the depth of the SWG game world would give Digiteers ample
tools for engaging storytelling in the Star Wars universe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Failures</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although
there've been some examples of Live events, this feature was never exercised to
anything even remotely resembling its full potential.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There was
never any question that SWG was incomplete as long as players couldn't do
things &quot;in space.&quot; Not only was this a crucial aspect of recreating
the feel of the movies, it was another opportunity to build on the success of
the &quot;X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter&quot; multiplayer combat concept. So
implementing Jump to Lightspeed was a non-negotiable requirement. What made the
actual implementation brilliant was the decision to make it a
&quot;twitch&quot; style game -- that is, instead of a click-to-go-there
RPG-style interface, a player's success in space would be dependent on his or
her own abilities. The system of advancement through NPC missions was also an
improvement on the undirected grinding of XP in the ground game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Failures</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>JtL's
failures were threefold. First, there were few good reasons to group. The
massed Rebel attack on the Death Star was what players wanted, but JtL offered
few such opportunities (especially for non-Master pilots). Second, it was never
sufficiently integrated with the ground game. You were either in space, or on
the ground -- JtL played like a completely separate game from SWG, and that was
a missed opportunity to make both more enjoyable. Third, and ultimately most
serious, was that JtL overemphasized combat. Because there was nothing else to
do, because there was no &quot;depth&quot; to space-based gameplay, once you
were done with the combat game you were done with Jump to Lightspeed -- there
was no persistent world activity to give players a reason to stay in space. The
decision to make combat gameplay exciting wasn't wrong, but the decision to
focus on combat to the exclusion of everything else was. Space mining may
(finally) be an interesting non-combat space activity; the question is whether
it is too little and comes too late to retain the player base that JtL started
out with and might have kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG
shipped with a strong NPC mission system in place. Despite a few bugs (such as
escort missions where the NPC being escorted would get &quot;lost&quot;), there
was a fairly good mix of missions; missions were appropriate for a player
character's abilities, and with some work it was relatively easy to find NPC
mission-givers. The availability of mission terminals also supported
independent gameplay for the more casual player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Missions
never seemed to be connected to each other -- there was never a Larger Goal of
Galactic Import to be achieved by completing smaller sub-missions. This made
individual missions feel like grindable busy-work. Worse, in many cases
missions had no Star Wars flavor, but seemed generic. Finally, although the
existence of the NPC mission system demonstrates that it is possible for the
system to detect when a mission is complete, no system allowing players to give
each other missions has yet been implemented or is even known to be
contemplated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Entertainers
as a type of gameplay was a concept virtually unique to SWG. Not only would
this allow players to enjoy acting out the kinds of things they'd seen in the cantina
in Mos Eisley, and in Jabba's palace, but it would support the valuable
social/roleplayer playstyle. To insure that they served an meaningful role in
the game, Entertainers were thus given abilities that made them indispensable
to other players, and that were activated as part of the process of playing
music or dancing (both of which were implemented through clever systems
allowing the integration of the actions of multiple players).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The only players
who needed entertainers (of any kind, including Image Designers) were combat
players. This limited the value of all entertaining professions. The Battle
Fatigue healing function was essentially the only useful thing that musicians
and dancers were given to do -- there was little other reason to dance or play
music once the new songs and dances were earned and experienced a few times. In
the end, entertainers were never fully integrated into the game by giving them
a wide range of interesting and useful social interaction abilities. (The
recent change to allow &quot;inspirations&quot; that enhance XP for all types
of players is a small step in the right direction.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG was
widely hailed as graphically beautiful. Although the price of beauty was slow
screen updating unless you could afford the burliest CPUs and graphics cards,
sunrise on a mountaintop on Naboo was breathtaking. NPC cities were wonderfully
designed and rendered, and NPCs and creatures (both hostile and peaceful) gave
each world life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Not
enough music from the movies!&quot; remains a common player complaint.
Creatures stand around waiting to be killed for XP, rather than migrating or
interacting with the local ecosystems. And for a long time, creatures weren't
even spawning at all on some planets. Player cities, although an interesting
feature, killed off all but two or three NPC cities -- every other NPC city is
a depressing ghost town. NPCs seem not to care when blaster fire scorches the
air near them -- why doesn't every armed NPC in earshot run to see who's being
attacked (and then act accordingly), while unarmed NPCs dash about with their
hands in the air screaming in fear?<b><span style='color:yellow'> </span></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
the other half of any Advanced Trading game ought to be the ability for players
to fully participate in criminal factions such as Jabba's and semi-criminal
factions such as the Trade Federation. Not only does this create numerous
gameplay opportunities for every player (including/especially Smugglers and
Bounty Hunters), it's absolutely in line with the spirit of Star Wars episodes
IV, V, and VI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Where are
our abilities to choose whether to play as a good being, or on the shady side
of the law, or as a vile gangster? This notion of &quot;choice&quot; (and the
related theme of redemption) is at the heart of every one of the Star Wars
stories. It's implemented insofar as we can play Rebels and Imperials... but
where's the moral ambiguity of everyone else to give our actions a deeper
meaning?</span></p>
