<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To my

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When
George Lucas wrote Star Wars, his best inspiration for how the &quot;evil
Empire&quot; was organized militarily was the Soviet Union. Historically the USSR (from its basis as a Russian civilization that is related to but distinct from our own
Western civilization) had two great assets: vast territory, and abundant
natural resources. These features led to a military doctrine that favored rapid
production of highly mobile units. From the mounted Cossack to the T-62 tank to
many MiGs, Russian/Soviet units have typically been relatively cheap to produce
and simple to repair and replace, allowing military leaders to quickly apply
military force at any place where a show of force was considered necessary.
(Note that although some Soviet/Russian fighter jets got lots of press for
having advanced features, these aircraft were not mass-produced front-line
units, but were often demonstration models brought to Farnborough or Paris to
make the rest of the world believe that the USSR was maintaining
military-technological parity with the West. Soviet fighter jet designers were
often creative and brilliant, but the most advanced aircraft were far too
expensive to produce in any meaningful numbers.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
corollary to this &quot;fast and cheap&quot; doctrine of warfare is that
individual units become expendable. The human beings who make up the individual
units of such a force are no more than meat; if you need more you just produce
more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By
contrast, Western military technology has from its earliest days embodied the
belief that the individual person has value. Therefore, rather than relying on
large waves of identical and expendable units, Western forces have historically
been composed of small squads of specialized units which emphasize high-tech
offensive power and defensive survivability. Cavalry (especially the mounted
knight) and the F-15 are examples of how Western military doctrine based on the
worth of the individual favors small numbers of technologically advanced units
with good defensive capabilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>With the
Cold War offering these two clearly distinct models of military organization,
it shouldn't be a surprise that Lucas developed the military organizations of
the Empire and the Rebellion as he did. Like the Soviet Union, the Empire in
Star Wars had a vast area of space to try to control. It also had access to
plentiful resources from the territories it controlled. So like the USSR, the
Empire needed to be able to throw large fleets of small, cheap, identical ships
at targets that could pop up anywhere in a vast expanse. The Emperor's solution
was the production of thousands of TIE fighters. Eliminating shields kept down
costs, and using twin ion engines but not including a hyperdrive allowed
excellent maneuverability once the fighters were conveyed to the battle site by
a hyperdrive-equipped carrier such as a Star Destroyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As the
Star Wars equivalent of Western civilization, the Rebellion used military craft
that were designed to be much more self-sufficient because the pilot inside was
considered to have intrinsic worth as a person, and thus was worth preserving.
(Also because Rebels are hard to replace!) Ships like X-wings and Mon Calamari
cruisers were more expensive than their counterpart Imperial ships, but the
Rebel ships were considerably more effective in one-on-one engagements because
they packed more firepower and offered far superior defensive technology. (The
Star Wars Databank, for example, offers the note that Mon Cal cruisers often
featured triple the number of shield generators of comparable Imperial
starships.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Taking
all this as our guide, if combat in the Space Expansion is to &quot;feel&quot;
like the Star Wars movies, then yes, a typical engagement should consist of a
few Rebel craft taking on a larger number of less powerful Imperial ships. Raw
numeric odds of 2-1 or even 3-1 should be common, while &quot;impossible&quot;
odds of 20-1 or worse (or better, depending on your point of view) should occur
from time to time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
three main problems with implementing combat in the Space Expansion in this
way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. &quot;<b>Fairness</b>&quot;:
The developers may believe that fairness requires them to make Imperial ships
just as good as Rebel ships so that people who want to fly as Imperials don't
spend all their time being blown out of the sky by the much more capable Rebel
ships. While I'd typically agree with this view, in the case of the Space
Expansion I think it would be detrimental to the feel of being part of the GCW.
Flying a dangerously inferior ship -- but having lots more squadmates to
support you -- should be a clearly acknowledged part of choosing to be an
Imperial. In fact, this is exactly the kind of difference that makes the Empire
different from the Rebellion! There's no reason to choose one over the other if
their capabilities are identical. Rebels -- because their ships, while more
advanced, are more expensive, and because the Rebellion should have less access
to resources -- should need to protect their ships by fighting only battles
they can win and running away when they can't. And Imperials -- because their
ships are weaker but less expensive -- should need to work together in large
packs to react to rebel incursions in unexpected parts of the galaxy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. &quot;<b>GCW
stats</b>&quot;: If Rebel and Imperial ships really are implemented with
different capabilities, then the calculations for who's winning the GCW should
take this disparity into account. On a raw numeric basis, it's likely that
there'll be a lot more Imperial ships destroyed than Rebel ships. If the
calculation for who's winning the GCW just uses a raw numeric count for Space
Expansion stats, that would tend to misleadingly skew the results to the
Rebellion. Consider an engagement where the Empire destroys a flotilla of 20
Rebel ships, while the Empire loses 30 of its own 40 ships. Using a raw numeric
calculation, the Rebellion is the winner because the Empire lost more ships
even though the Rebel fleet was wiped out! So if there's a real disparity
between the average capabilities of Imperial and Rebel ships of comparable
classes, then the GCW calculation needs to bias the raw numeric result of every
engagement by some &quot;difficulty factor&quot; based on the difference in
average capabilities. If (for example) the average Rebel ship is twice as
capable (in terms of power, defenses, weapons, and other systems) as the
average Imperial ship, then instead of the Rebellion winning the above
engagement 20 to 30, the Empire would have won by 40 to 30 (since the 20 Rebel
ships, at a 2-1 bias, would have been worth 40 Imperial ships).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. &quot;<b>PvE
vs. PvP</b>&quot;: If Rebel and Imperial ship capabilities are allowed to
differ, then the toughest problem isn't with PvE, where Imperial ships can be
spawned in reasonably appropriate numbers to match Rebel strengths (and vice
versa). (Although this probably will be a serious problem if the streets of
Bestine and Mos Espa, currently strewn with hundreds of stormtrooper corpses,
are any guide.) The real problem is in PvP action. It's just not going to
happen that often that &quot;appropriate&quot; numbers of Rebel ships will meet
&quot;appropriate&quot; numbers of Imperial ships. It's much more likely that a
lone Imperial will be dry-gulched by some roving band of Rebel marauders, or
that a lone Rebel will mistakenly fly through an area of space next door to an
Imperial PA's gathering point. No matter what, PvP in the Space Expansion is
likely to be unpleasant for the solo player. If the capabilities of Imperial
ships are allowed to be less (on average) than Rebel ships, the servants of the
Empire are likely to feel even more unhappy about PvP.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
said all this, I still think allowing Imperial ships to be less capable on
average than Rebel ships is worth doing. It's more &quot;historically&quot;
accurate; it's more in keeping with Star Wars canon; and -- most important for
SWG -- it helps distinguish the playing experience of being a Rebel from that
of playing as an Imperial.</span></p>
