<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Cooperative
Play</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2006/06/27</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>These MMORPG things need
more cooperative play options.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Of course that's a tricky
thing to do. What the heck do we mean by &quot;cooperative&quot; play, anyway?
Everybody knows what competitive play is like, but how do you implement the
alternative? Worse, how does a designer offer cooperative play if doing so will
be used by two players just to level each other up or gain money or loot
rewards by playing like bots?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>First, I think it's
important to recognize that just as there are different levels of competition
-- tactical, operational, strategic -- there are different levels of
cooperation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Combo moves are one type
of tactical cooperation that's starting to get some attention. (The MMORPG
Hero's Journey from Simutronics, for example, will be offering this feature.)
Something similar could probably be designed for crafting by a clever designer,
or even for socializing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>But what about operational
and strategic cooperation? I can't think of any MMORPG that has even considered
such features, much less implemented them. That would be a game that would
definitely get my attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Second, regarding how to
encourage cooperation generally, I feel pretty strongly that the
ubercompetitive nature of most MMORPGs is driven by their fundamental design as
zero-sum games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Most MMORPGs are built as
&quot;lands&quot; on some individual world, or as a few planets... and that's
all there is. Those are the only places you can be. Which means that any game
that allows players to compete for places are zero-sum games -- you just fight
over the same patch of ground over and over and over again because that's all
you can do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>A non-zero sum game takes
that pressure off by offering an alternative. Instead of competing for scarce
resources, players can choose to add to the total number of resources through
exploration and discovery. In effect, they can compete by cooperating to see
who can add more resources to the game world the fastest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Very few gameworlds offer
a non-zero-sum game. The only such game I can think of that's actually running
currently is EVE Online. It's still highly competitive, however. Because the
number of star systems, while relatively large (~5000), is still fairly low
compared to the number of players, and because maintaining security in these
player-run systems is a full-time job, players compete fiercely to keep what
they've been able to wrest from tough NPCs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>An even more non-zero-sum
game is currently being developed, called Infinity: The Quest for Earth.
Although I disagree with some of the design decisions being made, there's one
that I agree with wholeheartedly. (In fact, it's something I wanted to do
myself before I ever even heard of Infinity.) Namely, Infinity's playing field
will consist of literally billions of procedurally-generated worlds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>With that many worlds, it
will take years before players are able to explore (much less exploit) even a
fraction of them. And that should be enough to take the pressure off players
to compete over every square inch of known ground, enabling cooperation as a
viable way to play the game.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Verdana'>So where are the other
persistent online games that offer both strategic and non-zero-sum play? Why
expect cooperative play to emerge if the game isn't designed to encourage
and reward such play?</span></p>
