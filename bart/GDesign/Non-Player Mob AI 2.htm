<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Non-Player Mob AI, Part 2</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/06/28</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
bottom line problem with non-player mob (that is, NPC and creature) AI is that
it's reactive, not active. NPCs and critters are either loot bags waiting to be
popped or mindless quest dispensers. They don't act; they exist only to be
acted upon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To some
degree, that's how it has to be. Those are functions players want NPCs/critters
to have, so that's what developers give them. Except that developers stop
there. But why stop there?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well,
partly it's because there are only so many hours in a day, even if you work
programmers like galley slaves. (Something that courts are beginning to take a
dim view of.) Stop for a second and ask yourself: How many important systems
are there in a major MMORPG?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Go ahead,
come up with a number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now
multiply that number by 10, and you'll start to be in the ballpark of how many
systems there really are that somebody has to design, implement, and test. (And
you can easily double or triple that number if you also take into account
server code, behind-the-scenes &quot;helper&quot; systems, and tool
development.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>With so
much to do that absolutely has to get done, I'm sympathetic to not implementing
super-AI. &quot;Minimally plausible&quot; starts looking like a more
appropriate goal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's also
the case that you don't necessarily want your mobs doing things when there's
not a player there to be affected by those behaviors -- that can be perceived
as a waste of processor cycles. (Do you want <i>more</i> lag?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
there's the argument that despite what some of them may say, most players don't
actually want mobs that are smart enough to wipe the floor with them. The
highly gameplay-oriented players -- to whom most MMORPG developers cater
slavishly -- want mobs they can beat so that they can take their stuff.
(Actually, that applies to PvP as well, but that's another thread.) Making mobs
smart enough to run away or gang up on a player might wind up being very
unpopular with many of today's gamers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And
yet... what a waste of good mobs. If a MMORPG is a game world, then shouldn't
&quot;world&quot; be roughly as important as &quot;game?&quot; In which case,
shouldn't mobs be designed to support the goal of making the gameworld feel
like a living, breathing, dynamic place?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Bearing
in mind all the objections, I think the answer to that (as the editorialist
said) has to be &quot;yes.&quot; To make the gameworld as dynamic as it should
be to make it feel &quot;alive,&quot; mobs need to be more than loot bags and
quest dispensers. Instead of just existing to be acted upon, they need (to some
degree) to be independent actors themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
that accomplishing this will require non-player mob AI to improve in at least
four specific categories: agenda, environment, communication, and ecology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>AGENDA</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Agenda is
easy to describe, but hard to implement: mobs need to have goals and desires
and interests, and then (according to their level of intelligence) should be
able to devise and carry out plans that will plausibly allow them to achieve
their goals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In some
cases, that will mean that they do exactly what they do right now: stand around
and wait to be activated by a player. Maybe they're in &quot;guard&quot; mode,
which means patrolling a certain area to protect something (shops if they're
NPCs, babies if they're critters). Maybe they're just lazy and don't have a
job. Maybe they're injured, or lost. There are plenty of reasons why some mobs
could do exactly what they do now; the differences would be that there's a
plausible reason why they're doing it, and other mobs are capable of doing
something else because now they have a reason for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Being
able to form and carry out plans -- in other words, having an agenda -- along
with the subsidiary capability of being able to describe this agenda to players
who ask would tell players that they are part of a world that has a life of its
own. Creatures would seek to feed and breed. NPCs would have player-like
aspirations that they, like players, would attempt to fulfill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Not being
at the center of the universe could be a shock to some players... but there
are, I think, a lot of other players who would feel much more satisfied to be
playing in a gameworld where even the mobs have interesting stories to tell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>ENVIRONMENT</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why is it
that I can unleash electric death on an NPC and another NPC who is three feet
away -- who belongs to the same faction as the first NPC -- will simply
continue lounging against the wall?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>How can
that some creature can detect me from a hundred feet away when I'm behind a
tree, at night, wearing all black, downwind and masking my scent, and not
moving?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I cannot
think of a single MMORPG that implements the gameworld as a place where the
various emissions of the electromagnetic spectrum are used to any serious
degree. Most games let their mobs do simple A* pathfinding around collidable
obstacles. Some games give you line-of-sight. A few games allow terrain or
character position (standing/crouching/prone) to matter. But how many really
incorporate sound? Smell? Environmentally-appropriate camouflage? Reduction in
visibility due to darkness/rain/dust/fog/smoke? UV or IR detection/masking? Heat
or power signature detection/masking? Weight/mass detection (as for
pressure-sensitive switches)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Can you
imagine a game where mobs could detect and recognize other mobs (including
players) through all these environmental cues, and could incorporate that
information into their agendas?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Creatures
could stalk their prey, and prey could use various means (natural,
technological, magical, whatever) to avoid or break detection by predators.
NPCs could see or hear when their allies are being attacked and run to the
rescue. Mobs in general would become able to interact with each other and with
players in a vastly more plausible way because they would finally have access
to the same kind of environmental information that we as players take for
granted when we’re deciding what to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>COMMUNICATION</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Some mobs
are social. While individuals, they are also members of a group or groups.
Accordingly, these mobs ought to be able to communicate information to and
among each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A mob who
enters a &quot;danger&quot; or &quot;opportunity&quot; state ought to be able
to transmit that information to other mobs who could benefit from the
knowledge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When a
creature makes a kill, why can't he alert his packmates to come share in the
bounty when doing so helps to insure the group's survival? When an NPC sees an
enemy force coming over the town walls, why can't she race to the watchtower to
ring the warning bell, then run through the town calling for all allied NPCs
(and players!) to help repel the invaders?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A decent
level of communication capability would allow mobs to share these kinds of
useful information. Rather than acting purely independently, they would be able
to act together as a group. And that would finally allow mobs to effectively
match the ability of players to act in a coordinated way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Which
brings me to:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>ECOLOGY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Why is it
that I can whack the same mob eight zillion times, and he will respawn in
roughly the same place to allow himself to be whacked for eight zillion more
times? Why is it that I can wipe out an entire zoneful of orcs, and they'll
just reform in the same place as soon as I turn my back so I can wipe them out
again? How come I and other players can all take the same quest from the same
NPC for weeks at a time and he never learns to recognize us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Here's an
answer: Player actions have no long-term consequences because mobs have no
long-term memory or social decision-making capability. There's no ecological
response to repeated external stimuli.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The last
major component of a full, integrated mob AI system would be to allow groups of
mobs to change their behaviors over time. Creatures (as less intelligent mobs)
would simply react to player incursions by migrating elsewhere from their
hunting or feeding grounds. (Unless of course they happen to regard players as tasty
snacks, in which case maybe breeding rates go up to take advantage of the
unexpected bounty.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>NPC mob
groups would have even more types of long-term behavioral choices available to
them. Maybe when you wipe out an orc encampment several times, the orcs move
somewhere else. Now they're someone else's problem (or opportunity.) But
perhaps instead you've stumbled across a particularly warlike band of orcs, and
they don't take kindly to your depredations. So they've dispatched a runner to
invite some of their friends over to hide in the woods around their encampment.
The next time you show up to casually mete out destruction, you discover that
you're facing not five orcs, but fifty. Surprise!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Or
suppose a group of NPCs realize that a lot of players have been asking them for
a particular type of quest. What if the rewards for that quest become less
valuable to reflect an increased supply in reaction to demand? Conversely, what
if those NPCs decided to offer more quests like that one, since obviously it's
very popular? Why shouldn’t NPCs be able to change their behaviors in response
to the ways that players interact with them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As a
final example, what if an entire faction of NPCs decides that players have been
beating up on them a little too much, and coordinates a massive assault (maybe
physical, maybe economic) on some player resource or location? Isn't that
exactly the kind of large-scale action many players say they'd love to see in a
MMORPG?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An
ecological AI capability could enable precisely that sort of event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>----</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Agenda,
environment, communication, and ecology. Design your mob AI to incorporate
those capabilities, and you will have a gameworld that players will remember
with pleasure for years to come.</span></p>
