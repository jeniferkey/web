Standalone Skills</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/01/28</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is a
skills-based character ability system enough in and of itself to discourage
minmaxing? I don't think so… but I suspect it's good enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To start with,
let me spell something out: I think the flatter the curve describing the number
of characters with similar skills, the more fun the game is likely to be. So
the point of all this isn't &quot;discourage minmaxing&quot; -- it's to
encourage maximum diversity of character abilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If there
are any game-y features in your virtual world, you're going to get minmaxers.
There'll always be people whose entertainment comes from finding the saddle
points in any equation, and then deriving as much gain from that knowledge as
possible as quickly as possible. These are clever people by themselves, and
they're even more effective when they work together to divide and conquer a set
of data. And they'll do their thing regardless of whether power in your game
comes from class-derived abilities or skill-derived abilities. But there's a
still a difference in how this peak-seeking behavior can be addressed between
games with classes and standalone-skill games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A pure
class system (every skill in a class is unique to that class) is actually more
boring to minmaxers than a multi-classing or standalone-skill system. With a
pure class system you can only compare one full class against another for
power; it's an all-or-nothing deal. If you only offer a few classes, many
players will take the one &quot;best&quot; class. That can make your game world
look cookie-cutter pretty quickly -- the curve has just one very sharp peak.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The curve
flattens slightly if you offer many pure classes, since -- assuming you've
tried to power-balance the classes that have similar roles -- there'll be less
agreement about which is the &quot;best&quot; class. Even if there's some
argument about which class is the best, however, there'll still be a lot of
clustering around the top two or three contenders for best class. Now the curve
looks more like the classic bell curve as the &quot;best&quot; classes cluster
around one favored game role. (Another aspect of the many-class approach is
that you'll have to spend a lot of time generating the many distinct classes
available, which doesn't seem to be something many developers want to do.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
multi-classing system is a little more interesting to minmaxers because now
they can mix and match dissimilar skills; they can combine skills from systems
that were never thoroughly tested together (because no one ever imagined that
anyone could be interested in such a combination). In this case, what can
happen is that certain combinations will show &quot;spikes&quot; in power
(until whatever allows the spike gets nerfed), but those spikes will show up in
several different combinations. The result is that you again have just two or
three &quot;best&quot; combinations of classes, but there's less clustering
around a particular gameplay role than was the case in a many-class system --
the curve just appears to have several random spikes of the number of people
taking certain multi-class combinations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then
there's the the standalone-skill approach. This one has the same
&quot;problem&quot; as the multi-classing system, only in spades -- there are
likely to be more oddball combinations of skills that the QA folks or beta
testers didn't think to try... but the minmaxers will. So there are likely to
be more spikes as there'll be more combinations seen as having special benefits
-- but from the point of view of trying to maximize the diversity of character
abilities, that's actually a Good Thing. Each spike will be a little lower
since there are more of them available. The result is that the standalone-skill
model produces the flattest curve of characters with similar skill sets. There
are still spikes, but because it's harder to tell which complete set of skills
produces the overall &quot;best&quot; (most powerful) character, there are more
spikes and fewer players per spike -- i.e., a flatter curve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Therefore
I favor a system in which any player can learn any skill over one in which
skills are restricted by class. Not because the standalone-skill approach is
better at preventing min-maxing than a class system, but because the inevitable
minmaxing is distributed over a wider range of skill combinations.</span></p>
