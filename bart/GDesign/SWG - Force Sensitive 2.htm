On a side note, I'm curious as to why non-combat proffesion oriented players
would even want to be Jedi to begin with. You think they carry lightsabers to
chop down trees to build houses with? I mean, you got bounty hunters, the whole
galactic civil war thing goin' on, and so on an so forth. What're you gonna do
when a BH picks your name off a terminal, throw crafting tools at him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Azmodon
pointed out one reason: FS offers improvements to crafting. In SWG, where only
Master-level stuff sells, the advantages really matter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But more
importantly, who says being a Jedi is ONLY about fighting? Being a &quot;keeper
of peace&quot; in the Old Republic wasn't just about chopping off limbs, which
any buffoon with a reasonably sharp piece of metal can do -- it was primarily
about having the wit to understand difficult situations and determine the
course of action most likely to resolve the situation peacefully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sometimes
peaceful resolution isn't possible, at which point &quot;aggressive
negotiating&quot; may be appropriate. In fact, I would argue that negotiations
with a lightsaber should probably be the most common type of diplomacy
practiced by Jedi in SWG, and for three reasons:</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>this
     isn't the Old Republic; it is a time of unrest in the galaxy</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG is
     a game, not a conflict resolution simulation</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Star
     Wars and SWG are primarily about experiencing thrilling adventure</span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So sure,
Jedi in SWG ought to be able to fight. But the fighting ought to be for a
reason; even Dark Jedi don't just whip out the lightsaber and start randomly
killing things without some larger purpose in mind. If being a Jedi is about
solving problems (rather than just random murder), then there ought to be other
gameplay styles available to Jedi that are other ways to solve problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
developers of KOTOR understood this concept (though they didn't take it as far
as I'd have liked). If you wanted to play KOTOR in full-frontal hack-n-slash
mode, you could do so by building your Strength/Dexterity to be a Jedi
Guardian. But KOTOR also let you focus on gaining enhanced Force powers through
improving your Intelligence/Wisdom as a Jedi Consular. You could even choose a
balance between the two playstyles as a Jedi Sentinel. So why shouldn't SWG
take a similar approach to welcome both combat-oriented and puzzle/social-oriented
players?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you're
not forced to be a great diplomat to be a Jedi in SWG, why should others be
forced to be great fighters to be Jedi?</span></p>
