<br>
I'd like to begin by clearly stating my thesis: I think Star Trek Online (ST:O)
needs functionally detailed player starships for players to live in and use for
exploration of the game universe.<br>
<br>
This post is intended to try to make the case for this suggestion. I understand
that it's not the current direction for ST:O's design, but I believe it should
be -- I think it's necessary if ST:O is to successfully exploit the Star Trek
license. I also understand that this isn't a new proposal, but I think (I
hope!) that I'm bringing something new to the discussion by offering some very
specific ideas to beat up on.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, what follows is a design vision of how groups of players can work
together aboard starships in a way that communicates the spirit of Star Trek
while also being fun as MMORPG gameplay.<br>
<br>
I know this is not the flavor of the month right now. As of April 2007, Perpetual's
position on the subject of player ship interiors with functional control
stations could best be summarized as &quot;ST:O will not be a starship simulator.&quot;<br>
<br>
With respect, I believe that position needs to be challenged. Why is tactical
effectiveness for the combat-oriented gamers controlling the gameplay design
for all ST:O players? Why not &quot;simulate&quot; some of the cooler aspects
of operating Star Trek starships? Using the advanced technology aboard a
starship to solve problems has always been one of the things that made Star
Trek fun. Lose that, and you instantly lose a significant portion of Star
Trek's appeal.<br>
<br>
Of course an online game will be different from a TV show or movie. Some things
will need to be cut; that's understood. And it's also understood that there
will be some gamers who only want to experience ST:O as a tactical combat game.
Supporting them is fine, but what about everybody else? What about the people
for whom the spirit of Star Trek is its humanism and intelligence in creative
problem-solving? Shouldn't starships in ST:O be fun for them, too?<br>
<br>
The problem with designing ST:O's starships as just mobile spawn points in a
3rd-person tactical fighting game is that this fails to make full use of the
Star Trek license. As the example of Star Wars Galaxies shows all too
painfully, if a game makes too many compromises to conventional MMORPG play,
rather than insisting on features that capture the spirit of the license, the
many people who were drawn to the license won't be attracted enough to the game
to subscribe to it (and stay subscribed). That might work for a combat-only
Warcraft, but who here truly believes that Star Trek, with its emphasis on
ethical exploration, is that kind of license?<br>
<br>
So of all the things to cut, such a critical part of the Star Trek experience
as starship operation should not be on the hit list. Not only does that
eliminate a core Star Trek experience, it fails to take advantage of a rare
opportunity to offer innovative and enjoyable group gameplay beyond the
conventional tactical combat of every other MMORPG. Not letting players work
together to operate the systems of their ships is likely to mean fewer
subscribers to the game because a crucial aspect of Star Trek is missing.
Nobody will win when that happens.<br>
<br>
I don't just mean &quot;Star Trek Online needs to do ship interiors,&quot;
either. If ship interiors are rendered prettily, well, that's nice, but
enabling players to wander around inside a ship and stare at the walls is not
my goal in this proposal. What counts is functionality. Players need to be able
to interact with the individual systems of their ships: modifying shield
harmonics, transporting objects with strange bio-signatures, reprogramming the
sensor array to pick up a garbled and faint distress signal -- those are the
kinds of things that matter in a Star Trek RPG! I'd be a lot happier if access
to these systems was through a 1st-person LCARS interface, but the main thing
is that ST:O lets players do the technology-manipulating things that Star Trek
characters are supposed to be able to do.<br>
<br>
Actually, I want to commend Perpetual for proposing the &quot;hub&quot;
concept. If anything, I don't think it goes far enough. I think the majority of
player ships need to be operable as multi-person vehicles containing complex
systems that multiple players can access simultaneously; that's where most of
the socialization in ST:O should be. But implementing ships and stations as
complex systems that players will be able to interact with is an attempt at a
compromise, and I respect that.<br>
<br>
That said, I'd like Perpetual to see how far this idea can be pushed. I believe
they'll find that many of the people who come to ST:O for the Star Trek
experience will expect starship operations to be a core gameplay element, and
will be disappointed when they discover that ST:O's design focus for starships
is on &quot;exciting&quot; destruction. ST:O needs the exploration-focused
group vehicles that are a fundamental part of Star Trek, and it needs them to
be standard-issue by design.<br>
<br>
I realize that I'm swimming upstream on this one, and I'm definitely not trying
to annoy anyone, so I won't be offended if the general feeling is that I've
wasted my time on all this. Even if the core vision described here has no
chance of being applied in ST:O, perhaps some of the associated ideas may prove
useful in designing gameplay for &quot;hub&quot; ships. And if nothing else, I
had fun developing these ideas -- it's been an interesting exercise in systems
design.<br>
<br>
So to anyone who's suffered through this introduction and who survives the
following exposition -- thank you! I hope you'll find something you like here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>&quot;CRAFTING&quot; AS AN ICONIC STAR TREK ACTIVITY</b><br>
<br>
In the universe of Star Trek, characters always face challenges.<br>
<br>
Sometimes these challenges are physical, requiring the character to face a fear
of injury or death. Sometimes the challenges are social, such as negotiating a
peace treaty, establishing a trade agreement, or initiating a first contact.
And sometimes the challenges are ethical, as when a character's fidelity to the
Prime Directive is tested. If Star Trek Online's gameplay fairly represents the
license, we can expect to see plenty of all these types of situations.<br>
<br>
But the Trek mythos is nearly unique in popular fiction in how often characters
are required to surmount intellectual challenges -- in particular,
technological challenges. In the world of Trek, there are innumerable occasions
when neither brute force nor diplomatic savoir-faire will work -- the only way
to solve a difficult problem is through the creative use of advanced
technology.<br>
<br>
I think the path to providing fun intellectual challenges to ST:O players can
be summed up in one simple word: &quot;crafting.&quot; Not crafting in the
sense of manufacturing, of making stuff to sell in an in-game economy, but
crafting in its larger sense of creating interesting new things. The art and
science of crafting is the exploration of technology... and that, in the
service of an ethic of curiosity about and respect for sentient beings, is
exactly what Star Trek has always been about.<br>
<br>
In short, Star Trek Online needs crafting. And the best way to get it is by
designing all of the hardware and software objects in the game -- especially
including starships and their systems -- to be decomposable into components
that can then be recombined in novel ways.<br>
<br>
Although this concept should apply to every object, from handheld tools to warp
cores, by far the most important vehicle for it is the starship. Not only are
starships crammed with groovy technogadgets and clever software programs, they
are full of that most glorious of resources: systems. For all their advanced
hardware and software, without the systems that organize and control those
things a starship would just be a box full of parts. When they're pieces of an
intelligently-designed system, however, and those systems are operated by
people who share a common goal, the whole supersystem becomes more than just
the sum of its parts -- it becomes an incredibly powerful tool for exploration.<br>
<br>
Working with the many systems that constitute this exploratory tool is what
characters in the Trek universe do. They travel to distant places, seeking out
new life and new civilizations, and they use the powerful systems of their
starships to solve the problems that explorers inevitably encounter.<br>
<br>
Which means that to see how crafting can work in ST:O, we need to look at how
Trek characters use a starship's systems. Anyone who's tried their hand at
designing a starship knows that there are many pieces, but how do those pieces
fit together as an organized collection of systems? And how do Trek characters
interact with those systems to achieve specific goals?<br>
<br>
Our first step in answering these questions will be to enumerate the best-known
systems of Star Trek starships. Then we'll examine those systems according to their
organizational structure. Finally, we'll consider the functional interactions
that bring these systems together to form a fully operational starship. At that
point we'll have a good idea of how a starship works, which will enable us to
discuss in a concrete way how players can interact with these systems.<br>
<br>
Ultimately this should demonstrate how starships are a crucial mechanism for
enabling players to craft new things in ST:O in a way that's both consistent
with the spirit of Star Trek and fun as a set of MMORPG features.<br>
<br>
So let's get started, already!<br>

The first thing to observe about this list is that I've divided up shipboard
activities into the standard three branches: Command,
Engineering/Operations/Tactical, and Science. These correspond to the modern
era uniform colors: Command and Helm in red, Engineering, Ops and Tactical in
gold, and Science and Medical in blue or teal. (I use the term
&quot;Tactical&quot; rather than &quot;Security&quot; since Tactical seems to
encompass Security, Fire Control, and Communications actions in modern era Trek
shows.)<br>
<br>
I think this list fits the accepted conventions for Trek organization in the
modern era (that is, from A.D. 2351 through at least 2405 according to the
excellent &quot;Spike's Star Trek Page&quot; of uniforms at <a
href="http://www.st-spike.org/pages/uniforms/uniforms.htm)" target="_blank">http://www.st-spike.org/pages/uniforms/uniforms.htm<span
style='color:black'>)</span></a>. But there are a number of reasonable
questions that could be raised.<br>
<br>
The first concerns the inclusion of Medical as a subsystem of Science. After
all, the medical staff from ST: TNG onward wore teal- or green-colored uniforms
rather than blue. For that matter, they probably have their own department
within SFHQ (I expect someone can tell us that for sure). But for purposes of
simplicity and consistency within ST:O as a game, it seemed to make sense to
include Medical as one of the major departments within the Science branch
despite their wearing the teal/green uniforms rather than the standard blue of
Science. Does anyone feel strongly otherwise?<br>
<br>
Speaking of Medical, where's the Ship's Counselor? I went back and forth on
this one for a while, but ultimately concluded that while it might be an
appropriate role on a ship's Table of Organization, there's no &quot;ship
system&quot; that is operated by a Counselor. (Having an office doesn't count.)
Since ship systems are what I'm trying to represent here, I decided that Ship's
Counselor didn't need to be shown. But I'm open to alternative viewpoints on
this one, too.<br>
<br>
Another issue I had to wrestle with is the relative paucity of Science systems.
When does a duty posting include enough scientific activity to need a Science
Officer? In reviewing the various Trekanalia, I found that there's very little
consistency on when a posting might or might not include a Science Officer to
handle a large science department. The original NX-01 <i>Enterprise</i>
included a Science Officer. So did the Constitution-class <i>Enterprise</i>s,
as did Deep Space Nine. But neither the Galaxy- nor Sovereign-class <i>Enterprise</i>s
had a dedicated Science Officer (rather surprising for the NCC 1701-D), nor did
<i>Voyager</i>. In the latter cases, science seems to have been one of the
(many) responsibilities of the Ops officer. (There's also a story that Gene
Roddenberry didn't like the way Brent Spiner looked as Data in Science blue.
Putting Data in the gold uniform wound up creating the concept of the
Operations department.) To try to reflect this, I've assigned the systems
related to applied sciences to Ops, and the basic sciences that remained
(including Medical) I assigned to the Science branch. That meant Ops got
Astrometrics / Stellar Cartography. I think that makes sense, but moving it to
Science (under Physics?) might be worthwhile if there's a good case to be made
for it.<br>
<br>
Yet another reasonable question might be why Ops and Engineering (and Tactical)
are divvied up the way they are. With a few exceptions (primarily Shuttle Ops
and Cargo Ops), all these systems are maintained by Engineering but used by Ops
or Tactical... so who &quot;owns&quot; them? Given the practical need to
balance these departments so that no one wound up with too many
responsibilities, I chose to organize their systems on the basis of whether an
individual system was primarily related to information collection or
operational processes -- either of those went to Ops, everything else went to
Engineering. The exception was Communications, which somehow wound up being a
duty of the Tactical officer. So obviously this distribution of the subsystems
is somewhat arbitrary, but I think it's a pretty close approximation of what
the Ops officers on the various TV shows did. It also seems to produce a
reasonably balanced grouping of systems within each department, which is
important for gameplay. Still, if someone wants to quibble, there's room to do
so.<br>
<br>
A final item worth pointing out is that not all starships will implement all
these systems. The bigger ships will have most of them, but smaller ships
won't. For instance, an in-system tug might have multiple tractor beam emitters
but no torpedo launchers or warp drive. And even most of the bigger starships won't
require a &quot;space boss&quot; to manage fighter operations because only a
few ships are carriers. (I'm assuming carriers can exist in ST:O even though
they never got much use in any of the TV shows or movies... and why not, I
wonder?) So the fact that some ship system is on this list doesn't mean it's
installed on a particular ship. I'm just listing the possibilities.<br>
<br>
OK, then -- taking into account all these exceptions and questions, how do
these systems look to you? I didn't go into great detail -- for example, I
didn't list &quot;densitometer&quot; as a type of passive short-range Sensor,
or &quot;dilithium articulation frame&quot; as part of the Warp system --
because I was trying to list operational systems, not specific devices. With
that distinction in mind, are there any systems I failed to list that ought to
be included? Are there things I listed that shouldn't be there? And what about
the organization of the systems I did list -- in your opinion, are they shown
where they should be, or is there a more appropriate way to group them?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF A STARSHIP'S KEY SYSTEMS</b><br>
<br>
Assuming this list is reasonably close to the kinds of things that players
would like to be able to do on a Trek starship, let's now move up a level and
look at how these systems are organized in terms of shipboard personnel:<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="org.png">
<br>
The Command branch includes Command functions plus Helm and Navigation systems.
Personnel assigned to Command and Helm departments wear red uniforms. Note that
serving at the Helm of a starship is usually considered an important milestone
in a career path eventually leading to command.<br>
<br>
Engineering, Operations and Tactical departments share numerous systems --
Engineering maintains them, while Ops and Tactical use them. These systems
include the important support systems of a starship: Power generation, Computer
services, Sensors, Tactical (offensive/security) and Defensive systems,
Propulsion, and several valuable subsystems which I've aggregated as Auxiliary
systems. Personnel assigned to Engineering, Ops, and Tactical all wear gold
uniforms to reflect their close working relationship.<br>
<br>
Under Sciences are Medical, Life Sciences and Physics. While ships of any size
may have a Medical department (and some ships, such as the future Hope-class
ships as seen in ST: TNG &quot;All Good Things&quot;, may have large Medical
contingents), it is primarily the ships designed for long-range exploration
that will also have Physics and Life Sciences departments. Physics and Life
Sciences departments will report to the Science Officer if one is posted;
otherwise they will be under the direction of the primary Operations officer.<br>
<br>
Each of the three branches is represented at Starfleet Headquarters by
appropriate members of the admiralty, who are responsible for setting policy
and making high-level personnel assignments for each branch under the direction
of SFHQ leadership.<br>
<br>
This organization of systems seems OK. Even so, I'd like to suggest a change to
it for ST:O. If I were designing a game set, oh, I don't know, 20 or so years
after the events of ST: Nemesis, I think I might want to make a few minor
alterations to Starfleet's branch organization. Specifically, I'd move Tactical
to the Command branch and put those personnel in ST:O's spiffy new red
uniforms. Not only would this better reflect the life-or-death decision-making
by Tactical officers that is typical of Command personnel, from a gameplay
standpoint it would shift some of the systems from the overloaded gold-branch
to the red-branch, which is pretty empty with just Command and Helm systems.<br>
<br>
For now, though, let's assume the organization as described above is retained
for ST:O. With these organizational assignments in mind, let's next consider
the functional structure of a ship's key systems.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>THE FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE OF A STARSHIP'S KEY SYSTEMS</b><br>
<br>
This next diagram offers one possible interpretation of how the different
systems of a large starship could interact functionally:<br>
<br>
<IMG SRC="func.png">
<br>
Obviously this diagram is a little busy, but that does serve to make the point
of how deeply interconnected all of the many systems of a starship are with
each other. There are a lot of things to do on a working starship!<br>
<br>
The key resources that need to be communicated are control, power and
information. Command receives information from the officers in charge of the
ship's key systems and gives control commands to these officers. Power must be
supplied to each of a ship's systems as requested (under the watchful eye of
the Ops officer). And the computer not only provides control to certain systems
(such as Power), its primary function is to provide information to any systems that
ask for it through a control request. Finally, some systems (such as Sensors
and Auxiliary, or Medical and Life Sciences) share information directly with
each other.<br>
<br>
This complexity is not arbitrary. The reason why starships are able to function
so effectively in the hostile space between the stars is because their systems
are so well integrated -- the systems that need to talk to each other are
connected so that they can do so. And because there are so many connections,
there is redundancy of control. If a system is damaged, it is often possible to
route control or power or information around the problem. (We'll examine this
in more detail in a moment.)<br>
<br>
You'll also notice that I've grouped certain systems into &quot;elements.&quot;
For example, the Helm element contains the Helm system (comprised of Conn and
Navigation) and the Propulsion system; the Tactical element includes Tactical and
Defense systems; and so on. (For various reasons, the Command system is its own
element.) This additional level of organization helps to show the interplay
among high-level systems during the actual operation of a starship -- some
connections are closer than others.<br>
<br>
Another somewhat subtler aspect of the functionality diagram that bears comment
is that while the Command element normally controls the other elements, in a
pinch those elements can operate autonomously. In other words, with Helm being
its own element, the duty helmsman has the capability to take action without
control from the Command element if warranted by circumstances. And the same
applies to Ops, Engineering, Tactical and Science -- in a pinch, each of these
elements might be called on to save the day, and each is capable of doing so.
There might be an inquiry afterwards, but the capability is there by design for
those occasions when it's needed. So although there are obviously a lot of
connections between systems, those systems are also grouped in ways that enable
ship elements to function when cut off from other elements.<br>
<br>
A last point on this diagram is in some ways the reverse of the previous point
(but they're not mutually exclusive). Although elements are to some degree
independent of each other, there are also many connections between elements.
Not only does this support the concept of rerouting power and information, it
also enables the related concept of allowing control of systems by alternate
elements. For example, a severe ion storm might cut off some parts of a ship
from other parts -- if the Helm system were destroyed and its duty officer
lost, the Tactical officer might be called on to maneuver the ship to safety.
Having multiple connections to systems would allow the Tactical officer to
command the ship's computer to route power to the propulsion system, as shown
in the functional diagram. It might not be efficient, but it might be just
enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>BUT WHY SO COMPLICATED?</b><br>
<br>
After all these points, it's fair to ask: would starships in ST:O really need
to be this complicated? I think so. In the first place, this level of
complexity in a starship's form and function is a critical aspect of many Trek
storylines. People and their relationships are always the most important thing,
but the technology -- in particular, the operation of a starship -- helps to
highlight those stories. If that's not a core component of ST:O, it just won't
feel like Star Trek.<br>
<br>
Dramatic effect comes into play here as well. Probably the two most common
words regarding ship systems in all of the Trek shows are &quot;reroute&quot;
and &quot;divert.&quot; It seems like captains are always directing their Ops officer
or Chief Engineer to reroute power around damaged systems or divert all
available power to a key surviving system. It would be very strange, I think,
if a game that allowed players to be responsible for various ship systems
didn't include this capability, or the similar requirement that nearly all
ship's systems require an active link to the ship's computer. (How many times
have we heard exclamations like &quot;The starboard power coupling's
gone!&quot; or &quot;I've lost helm control!&quot; when a critical system loses
its access to power or the main computer?)<br>
<br>
Implementing starships in ST:O according to the functional structure diagram
above would support this dramatic redirection of ship resources. Players with
the appropriate authority, like their fictional counterparts, could help save
the ship and its mission by diverting power from life support to the shields at
a critical moment, or by restoring helm control by rerouting it to a
workstation in Engineering that still has computer access, and so on. These
kinds of actions would be creative tasks that would allow ship's personnel to
shine by devising novel solutions to tough problems... just like they do on
Star Trek.<br>
<br>
An important second reason for giving starships some serious depth is that many
of those who'll be drawn to a game like ST:O will, I think, be the kind of
people who find complex systems more interesting (read: more fun) than
trivially simple objects. Certainly there's room for simple objects in any
MMORPG. But ST:O, if it's really going to honor the Star Trek ethos of
exploration, is exactly the right game to offer more exploratory depth for the
people who appreciate that kind of play.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>HOW DESIGNING STARSHIPS AS SYSTEMS ENABLES CRAFTING</b><br>
<br>
Which brings us -- finally! -- to &quot;crafting.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here's the summary: many of the tasks performed on a starship are routine. I
call these &quot;control tasks&quot; to indicate that they're about normal
control of ship systems. These are things like maintenance and simple repair
tasks, which don't call for anything particularly interesting from players.
Simulating that sort of thing in a MMORPG may be going too far.<br>
<br>
But some tasks can't be accomplished by routine actions. I call these
&quot;creative tasks&quot; to highlight their dependence on creative thinking
and novel solutions to unexpected and difficult problems. This is what ST:O's
design should be focused on offering to players, because this is what makes
characters in the Star Trek universe special.<br>
<br>
Creative tasks break down into two kinds: new ways of using existing tools
(where &quot;tools&quot; means hardware devices and software programs), and the
development of new tools. In turn, the development of new tools comes in two
flavors: writing short programs to alter an existing device's default behavior,
and creating new devices.<br>
<br>
Here's how this looks in outline form:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Control tasks </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'><br>
The creation of new programs and devices is what I mean by &quot;crafting&quot;
in the world of Star Trek. Using existing tools in new ways to solve a problem
is definitely a creative task, and I hope ST:O is designed to reward that kind
of gameplay. But it's also important for ST:O to reward the fabrication of new
things, which is a little closer to the notion of crafting in current MMORPGs
(and so may be more familiar to current online gamers).<br>
<br>
To provide a better idea of these categorizations, here are some examples of
each type of creative task from the various Star Trek TV shows and movies.<br>

color:black'><br>
The point to listing all these examples is to demonstrate that the creative use
of technology to solve problems is a fundamental part of Star Trek. Exploration
means encountering new situations that don't respond to old ways of doing
things. Being able to adapt to the unexpected is thus a hallmark of the
explorer.<br>
<br>
What's important to see here is that this creative adaptability -- building new
tools and using them in new ways -- is both interesting to do in its own right
and exciting when told as a story. Solving a problem that only occurred because
we made the deliberate choice to expand the horizons of our knowledge makes for
a dramatic story. All the best Star Trek episodes and movies showed that
creative problem-solving is fun and dramatic.<br>
<br>
Because Star Trek Online will be interactive, it needs both of those things
even more than the TV shows and movies. Implementing starships that are
detailed enough to give players many tools for solving challenging problems can
insure that ST:O players enjoy all the fun and drama of Star Trek, and then
some.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>STAR TREK CRAFTING IN DETAIL</b><br>
<br>
Now let's look a little more closely at the twin crafting concepts of making
new devices and writing new programs that change the functionality of devices.<br>
<br>
New devices are a Trek staple. One of the side effects of having stories based
on advanced technology is that if you need a &quot;McGuffin&quot; for a story,
you can simply declare that it exists. Name it with some bit of plausible
pseudo-scientific gibberish and you're good to go.<br>
<br>
The result of this in Trek is that new devices (new to both the characters and
to viewers/players) show up all the time. It's part of Star Trek; there's
always some new gizmo that's useful or dangerous (or both) to contend with, or
a need to make a new device to solve an urgent problem. So it's only natural
that new devices play a meaningful role in a Star Trek MMORPG as well.<br>
<br>
There are two ways to accomplish this. One is for ST:O developers to make like
Star Trek writers and pre-invent all the new devices that players will ever
encounter (perhaps through away missions). That would keep everything canon,
but it could chew up a lot of development time. Even worse, no matter how many
devices are written by the developers, players will discover virtually all of
them in a few months. Once the pregenerated content has been burned through,
then what?<br>
<br>
The other approach is to let players create their own new devices. This would
also require significant development time to do it right, but it has the
advantage of being dynamic content that changes for every player and thus never
gets stale. It would also do a much better job of letting ST:O players feel
like characters in the Star Trek universe because it lets players do what
they've seen Star Trek characters frequently doing.<br>
<br>
The key to letting players make new devices is for the developers to create
basic components, to build the standard set of supplied devices (including
starships) out of these components, and to give players a way to take devices
apart and put them back together again in new ways and with new components for
modified or new functionality.<br>
<br>
Suppose you've just finished trading with a representative of the Kylari
homeworld, and one of the things you picked up is a subspace phase modulator
assembly. Your existing phase modulator is pretty good, but it looks like your
subspace scans might be a little more accurate if you could figure out how to
integrate this new device into your sensor system. At this point in a TV
episode, your ship would get a distress call from somewhere in subspace --
wouldn't it be cool if you could save the day by analyzing the inputs and
outputs of the old and new devices and work out how to replace the old one with
the new one so that you can find the vessel lost in a subspace inversion?<br>
<br>
Or maybe you pick up an improved phase capacitor lattice on an away mission. If
devices are built from components, you might be able to field-strip your phaser
to use the new capacitor lattice for (say) improved collimation (i.e., more
thermal damage but at a significantly higher power drain). By being able to
break down devices into components and using different components of the
appropriate type to rebuild devices, players could use their ingenuity to solve
technological problems just like characters in Star Trek.<br>
<br>
Of course this is a massively multiplayer game. To keep this device-making
ability from getting out of hand so that Federation players don't rapidly wind
up with hand-held plasma torpedo launchers, several kinds of constraints could
be considered:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>only characters with Engineering or Ops experience
     have the skills necessary to tinker </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>many components have specialized interfaces (reducing
     the number of other components they can be connected to) </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>Federation devices tend to take only Federation
     components (ditto for Klingon devices, Romulan, etc.) </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>standard-issue gear is required for away missions </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>new devices must go through a lengthy process to
     become standard issue gear</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'><br>
These rules could definitely be tweaked; I'm just listing some ideas to
acknowledge that there'd need to be reasonable limits on creating new devices.
Not so much that this important aspect of Star Trek loses its impact, but just
enough so that Federation gear still feels like Federation gear after the game
has been going for a few years.<br>
<br>
The other concept needed to support crafting in ST:O is programming. At least
as often as characters invent new devices -- and probably more so -- they also
change how devices behave by modifying the programming that binds devices
together into complex systems.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you can get what you need by issuing a normal command to a device,
such as &quot;EPS manifold R-27, change your output route from EPS junction
34-A to 34-B&quot; or &quot;deflector emitter, apply a frequency modulation of
72.831 megacycles per second to the next tachyon pulse&quot; and so on. That's
the kind of thing I call &quot;new processes.&quot;<br>
<br>
But there are also times when changing a particular device's output isn't
enough -- you need to change how an entire system behaves on an ongoing basis.
That's when the programs controlling the standard behaviors of systems need to
be altered, either with modifications or with completely new programs.<br>
<br>
As the examples earlier showed, this kind of system-modification goes on all
the time in Star Trek shows and movies. Being able to tweak how a system
performs over time is a common task. It's not a &quot;control task&quot;
because it's something out of the ordinary, but it's common as a plot feature
in Star Trek fiction. It's also an interesting gameplay feature. Consequently, ST:O
would benefit from including it as well.<br>
<br>
As with devices, the most satisfactory way to let players program systems is
for the developers to build systems of devices with default programming, and
then allow players to change those system-control programs. In effect, ST:O
would have its own standard computer language for controlling and connecting
devices. Complex systems (such as warp drives and sensor arrays) would be built
by Perpetual out of devices and programs that reside on the local computers
that connect those devices. When a player finds that the default system isn't
sufficient, he or she could rewrite its programming to improve it, making it
more efficient or giving it new capabilities.<br>
<br>
Naturally this feature needs to be carefully considered for how it would work
in a massively multiplayer online game. One of the most common objections to
letting players develop their own programs is that some players will choose to
use this power to annoy other players. It's a fair objection, but I think there
are also a couple of good responses that can be made to it.<br>
<br>
First, a familiar part of shipboard Star Trek is the concept of the
&quot;authorization code&quot; (or, in the case of command personnel, their
command codes). Although we tend only to see these used in dramatic situations,
it's been supposed that entering these codes is actually a standard action. When
you start to use a terminal or workstation, the first thing you do is enter
your auth code. This serves several purposes: one, it restricts your actions to
only those which you are authorized to perform; two, it tags everything you do
with your identity (and a timestamp); three, it can be used to lock hostiles
out of sensitive systems; and four, it accesses all of the LCARS keypad
configurations that you've predefined for performing specific activities. (More
on that in a moment.)<br>
<br>
The first three of these purposes serve the need for security. By restricting
actions to users with appropriate privilege levels, and by logging permitted
actions, the use of auth codes would limit griefing. (The third use of auth
codes, to lock systems, might be griefed, however.) Still, players serving
aboard a starship who use their power to compromise ship systems would likely
be caught and shown to the nearest airlock. Even better, restricting systems to
authorized (trusted) players only would make it harder for the typical griefer
to do real damage. In any event, &quot;programs&quot; to operate ship systems
are not at all the same thing as the macro and script commands used to automate
player actions in some current MMORPGs -- you might be able to automate a ship,
but characters couldn't turn themselves into AFK bots. (And even automating a
starship is not without risk -- remember what happened when Dr. Daystrom
plugged M5 into the <i>Enterprise</i>? Faulty programming of a starship's
systems should have consequences.)<br>
<br>
The second response to the &quot;players will abuse the power to write
programs&quot; objection is to point out that, in many of the Trek shows,
someone does abuse this power! Whether it's Spock faking library tapes (ST:
TOS, &quot;The Menagerie&quot;) or Ceska hiding a booby trap in Tuvok's mutiny
simulation (ST: VOY, &quot;Worst Case Scenario&quot;), it seems like someone is
always finding a way to circumvent the security features of starship computers.
If ships in ST:O can be boarded by hostiles, or NPCs serving aboard player
ships can ever turn out to be saboteurs, then allowing a certain amount of
leeway in spoofing a ship's computer might actually prove to be a game feature
that players would enjoy because it would let them live out the plot of a
typical Star Trek episode.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a more powerful objection to letting players write system-control
programs is &quot;people want to play a Star Trek game, not program virtual
computers.&quot; That's absolutely true... for some people. Those who prefer
more &quot;physical&quot; or social activities in the game world will no doubt
be able to satisfy those interests, but I'm confident that there are other
gamers (including people who like Star Trek) who would find equal enjoyment in
the technological problem-solving in a Star Trek setting that ST:O could
provide. For these gamers, the chance to save the day by reprogramming the
transporter system to accept an unscannable material (for example) would be an
incredibly satisfying experience.<br>
<br>
Taken together, I believe that offering these forms of crafting -- the ability
to create new devices and new programs to control a starship's systems -- is
such an iconic part of Star Trek that it is crucial to ST:O's success. Allowing
players to solve problems through the manipulation of advanced technology is a
great way to help them feel like a part of the Star Trek universe.<br>
<br>
Crafting as part of exploration is so fundamental to Star Trek that
implementing it in ST:O will contribute significantly to getting the most value
out of the Star Trek license.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>BUT WHAT DO SYSTEMS OPERATE ON?</b><br>
<br>
There's one other point that's related to &quot;crafting&quot; creative
solutions to difficult problems, but which isn't directly related to ship's
systems. That being the case, I won't go into detail about it here, but it's
worth mentioning. And that is the amazing variety of fields and particles and
waves and energies that make up the Star Trek universe. (As someone has put it,
&quot;Star Trek is one of the greatest sources of technobabble ever.&quot;
There's a reason why the neologism &quot;treknobabble&quot; was coined....)<br>
<br>
From tachyons to polarons to chronotons to vertirons and beyond, Trek is
overflowing with things that can be sensed and/or emitted. To truly allow ST:O
to feel like Trek, players will need to be able to direct the various systems
of their ships to detect these things and (when appropriate) to emit them in
multiple modes. Space needs to be full of all these forms of matter and energy
in order to give players materials for their ship's systems to operate on --
they are a prime source of challenges to be addressed in creative ways.<br>
<br>
This is a topic ripe for in-depth discussion....<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SYSTEMS OPERATION AND THE LCARS INTERFACE</b><br>
<br>
To close this subject of working with devices and programs and systems in a
Star Trek game, a note about LCARS interfaces. While I expect some differences
between how they work in film Trek and in a MMORPG (both for the sake of
novelty and because a game will surely require some compromises), I'd be very
surprised if the LCARS visual interface wasn't used somewhere in Star Trek
Online. Unless ST:O is going to support full voice recognition, we might as
well get some additional use out of all those Okudagrams!<br>
<br>
On the assumption that some version of the LCARS interface will be the means by
which players operate ship systems, the details of this interface are worth a
few observations as they relate to performing control tasks and creative tasks.<br>
<br>
Overall, I would suggest that some thought be given making certain functions
part of a common user interface. In particular, I think every display panel
should include at least the following components:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>a login/logout control (see the &quot;authorization
     code&quot; discussion above) </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>a Config control to allow screen components to be
     reconfigured (and the new config to be canceled or saved) </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
     font-family:Verdana'>a Function control that displays a list of saved
     configs for the current user</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'><br>
These aren't meant to constitute a complete list of common user components. I
expect there'll be more; this is just a first crack at a definition -- feel
free to suggest others! But these capabilities in particular would serve at
least three useful purposes.<br>
<br>
First, although every standard ship function should have a default LCARS
layout, allowing players to create their own screen layout for any activity
will allow them to perform their duties more efficiently. For example, Player A
might want to configure a helm control layout in which impulse and warp
controls are on the main screen and thruster controls are on a pop-up screen.
But Player B might prefer to lay out her helm control screen so that all three
modes are on the same page, with thruster controls on the left side because
she's left-handed. And Player C might want to have several helm control layouts
suited for different tactical situations. Allowing players to configure LCARS
screens will go a long way toward personalizing the game for each player,
increasing the sense of immersion in the Trek universe.<br>
<br>
Another aspect of allowing players to configure screens is to support players
with multiple shipboard responsibilities. Once they've configured layouts for
each of their tasks, a player will be able to switch between functions by
selecting the appropriate control. For example, an Ops officer could be
monitoring sensor channels when a telltale lights up indicating that a shuttle
launch is in progress. By pressing the Function control, then selecting the
config for the Shuttle Ops function, the LCARS display for shuttle operations
can be quickly displayed, allowing the Ops officer to inform the captain that
yet another unscheduled shuttle launch has occurred. (Those seem to happen pretty
regularly in the Star Trek universe, don't they?)<br>
<br>
Lastly, allowing displays to be defined for individual users will let players
bring up their preferred screens on whatever workstation they happen to be
using. This will be especially helpful for those players whose duties take them
all over the ship, as opposed to players whose functions have dedicated Bridge
or Engineering stations.<br>
<br>
In summary, this level of flexibility in control panel configurations would
enable players to respond quickly to challenging situations with creative
solutions. As the primary interface to modifying or using ship systems (in a
game that probably won't include computer voice recognition), it's important to
have a control system that players can tailor to their preferred styles of
thinking and acting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>STARSHIP SYSTEMS AS A VEHICLE FOR ETHICAL EXPLORATION</b><br>
<br>
There's a final reason I'd like to mention for designing ST:O so that players
can manipulate the advanced technology aboard powerful starships. It's that
giving a character power helps tell good stories.<br>
<br>
Technology in Star Trek has never been just about the gadgets -- it's always
about when to use those gadgets and when not to. In other words, the high tech
of Star Trek exists to raise questions (in dramatic form) about the right uses
of power. This is the same premise that drives all good science fiction -- when
advanced technology lets you do nearly anything you like, under what conditions
should you refrain from using your power? Should human limits still apply when machines
can augment your senses and skills and even intelligence? (Star Trek's Borg ask
this question in a startlingly direct way.)<br>
<br>
Star Trek has always held that with power comes responsibility. When you have
power over life and death, over time and space, and you choose to go exploring,
your power over the people you encounter will generate ethical dilemmas. When
is it right to use power, and when is restraint the right decision? This
conflict drives many of Star Trek's best stories:</span></p>

In particular, the Prime Directive has been the source of a vast amount of
storytelling in Star Trek precisely because it places self-imposed limits on
the use of power. Stories testing the boundaries of the Prime Directive have
been as valuable to Star Trek as stories testing the Three Laws of Robotics
were to Isaac Asimov, and for the same reason: the intersection where
hard-and-fast rules governing conduct meet the real world is where there's the
most potential for conflict, and conflict makes for good storytelling.<br>
<br>
How firmly do you hold to your principles that tell you to refrain from using
power? What about when using that power could save you from destruction or
relieve the suffering of innocents? When is it OK to bend your principles? How
far can you bend them before they break? That's the conflict at the heart of
great drama. It's been the source of many of the strongest stories in the Star
Trek universe.<br>
<br>
It can and should be the source of strong gameplay in Star Trek Online as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><br>
<br>
Which brings me at long last to my conclusion: implementing detailed and
powerful starships for players to use in Star Trek Online is such an effective
mechanism for bringing the spirit of the Star Trek license to life that it
should be a key design feature, not dismissed as a &quot;starship
simulator.&quot;<br>
<br>
Detailed and powerful player starships satisfy the two requirements for good
storytelling in the Trek universe. The detail enables crafting that would offer
ST:O players what legendary game designer Sid Meier has called
&quot;interesting decisions.&quot; And the power ensures that those interesting
decisions carry ethical weight. Without the detail or power, a core aspect of
Star Trek is lost -- either it's not possible to generate creative technological
solutions to problems, or those solutions are mere grinding without meaning. In
either case, it won't feel like Star Trek, and it won't be a fun online
computer game.<br>
<br>
Yes, Star Trek Online must do more than just tell a good story -- it needs rules
of play to make it a good game. Detailed starships and other devices enable
gameplay by offering a rich environment for crafting and tool-based problem
solving. But why stop there when it's possible to make a great game by ensuring
that ST:O's gameplay is driven by the deeper humanistic ideals of Star Trek?<br>
<br>
ST:O should be more than &quot;just a game,&quot; just as Star Trek was more
than &quot;just a TV show.&quot; And it can be, if the player operation of
detailed and powerful starships is a core design element.</span></p>
