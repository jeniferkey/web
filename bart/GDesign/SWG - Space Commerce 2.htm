<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I believe
that SWG and <i>Jump to Lightspeed</i> will be more fun with features that
support space-based commerce -- in other words, space needs to have features to
support both combat <i>and</i> commerce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To this
end, I've put together a number of ideas to support commerce in space. Some of
them I've already discussed in other threads, some are new. The main new idea I
get to toward the end of this message. If you're terminally impatient (heh) you
can skip to the &quot;SHIPPING TERMINALS&quot; section, but I hope you'll try
reading through the preliminary comments first -- they'll help the rest of this
message make more sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SPACE
EXPANSION: THE COMMERCIAL GAME</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I put
together a fairly detailed list of ideas to support space-based commerce in my
thread &quot;Space Expansion: The Commercial Game&quot; (Core Systems thread
#17565). This discussion wasn't so much about how to implement ideas for space
commerce as it was to talk about what kinds of commerce the Space Expansion
ought to have. It was a pretty good discussion, but I wouldn't mind giving
these ideas a little more exposure -- if anyone thinks it might be useful to
repost that thread over here in the actual Jump to Lightspeed forum, let me
know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The core
of that thread that relates to this one is the list of three main types of
space-based commercial service:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>passenger
     transportation </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>freight
     delivery </span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>cargo
     sales</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So how
can we get these features?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>PLAYER
CONTRACTS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
an idea I had a while back that would support space-based commerce without
needing to implement any other new features. This is because it's a major new
feature itself that goes well beyond supporting just space-based commerce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
the concept of Player Contracts. I've designed a contract system that would
allow players to establish long-term and repeated contracts with each other to
securely perform many different kinds of economic transactions, from the basic
goods-for-money trade we currently use to crafting, repair, guard duty, player
bounties(!), and even in-game marriage contracts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you'd
like to check out the details of this idea, you can read the messages in thread
#4421 in the Core Systems forum (&quot;Player Contracts: A Design
Document&quot;) -- there's also a somewhat shorter version (&quot;Player
Contracts: The Short Version&quot;) in thread #15183 of the Core Systems forum
that gives you all the details in one message. (Admittedly, it's not all <i>that</i>
short.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A couple
of the contract types I propose are Transport and Delivery. Transport contracts
allow you to make deals with players to move items or players to a specified
location; Delivery contracts let you agree to give specific items to another
player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If just
these two types of player contracts were available, we would have a formal,
game-backed way to perform two of the most requested space commerce services:
passenger service and freight delivery service. There's nothing preventing us
from doing these things informally the day that JtL ships... but it doesn't
appear that there'll be any features to reliably support doing those things,
either. And without a formal in-game system that protects the players who agree
in good faith to make contracts with other players, these kinds of commerce
just won't happen -- it'll be too easy to cheat the other guy by taking his
money or goods or services without providing the agreed-on payment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A game-implemented
contract system would be exactly the kind of formal system needed to be able to
make trustable deals. But how would this actually work in practice?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
feature of player contracts that would make a freight delivery system practical
would be contract terminals. As a freighter pilot, you'd be able to go to a
contract terminal near your favorite starport, find a delivery mission that
suits you, accept the mission, take &quot;delivery&quot; of the item (I put
delivery in quotes because you never actually see the item in your inventory --
it's put in a special contract account to prevent theft), travel to your
destination, and have the item &quot;transferred&quot; to the delivery
terminal, at which point your bank account is credited with the freight delivery
fee offered in the contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Sound
like it might work?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It must
be said that although the developers have discussed the idea of implementing
some system supporting player missions (which really is what my player contract
system winds up being), they haven't mentioned it publicly in months. Nor do
they show any signs of considering implementing anything like a player contract
or mission system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So is
there some other way to support space-based commerce? Is there some other
relatively simple feature the developers could implement that supports not just
freight delivery but cargo sales?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SHIPPING
TERMINALS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Having
gone through all the background details, let's cut to the chase. What we need
is this: Bazaar terminals that can be placed inside starports, and that have
been enhanced in two ways: to allow players to enter &quot;want ads,&quot; and
to provide automatic payments for delivering selected items to selected
off-planet destinations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(In what
follows, remember the distinction between freight and cargo: freight is stuff
you carry for someone else for a predetermined fee, while cargo is stuff you
buy in one place and carry to sell in another place in the hope of making a
profit between the two transactions.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What we
need is a new type of terminal -- a Shipping terminal -- that works just like a
Bazaar terminal but with a couple of enhancements and a restriction:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>has a
     new &quot;Wanted&quot; category (in addition to Armor, Misc, Resources,
     etc.)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>has two
     new columns on all item categories (except the new Wanted category):</span></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Delivery
      Location</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Delivery
      Fee</span></li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>is only
     found inside starports</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When you
offer an item for sale on the Bazaar terminal, you have the option of marking
it for delivery to another starport. If you take this option by selecting a
Delivery Location starport from a pulldown list, you're prompted to enter a
(non-zero) Delivery Fee as well. If you don't enter a Delivery Location, the
item is listed for sale just like items are listed currently. Otherwise the
delivery fee is immediately deducted from your bank account (if you can't pay
it, you aren't allowed to mark the item for delivery) -- that way when someone
delivers it they are assured of payment. If you later cancel the offer, the delivery
fee is credited back to your bank account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>[Question:
Would we want to allow items to be delivered to starport Shipping terminals on
the same planet as the source Shipping terminal? Or should the pick list of
possible delivery starports exclude all starports on the same planet where
you're placing the item for sale?]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Only
operators of multi-player ships would be able to accept freight delivery
missions from the Shipping terminal. Starfighters will already have plenty of
cool things that only they can do; they don't need to be able to haul freight
or cargo, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To
prevent the theft of freight, you never get the actual freight items in your
ship -- you just get a ship's manifest that lists the items you're moving from
one Shipping terminal to another. When you take a freight delivery contract
from a Shipping terminal, the item is marked and displayed as inactive to
anyone viewing that item in a Bazaar or Shipping terminal. If you get killed in
space, the item is marked back to active. Only when you successfully land at
your destination and redeed your ship is the item removed from the source
Shipping terminal, added to the destination Shipping terminal, and the delivery
fee deposited to your bank account with an in-game email message telling you
about the transfer. (It might also be nice to send an in-game email message to
the person who offered the delivery fee to let him or her know that the item
has been successfully delivered.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>[Note
that if piracy and docking are ever implemented, having a ship's manifest of
items being delivered would be a good source of items for pirates to steal.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>[Additional
enhancement: What about allowing anyone to mark an item for delivery, even
after it's originally been added by someone else to a Bazaar terminal? That way
if you're on Lok and you need 1000 units of Resource X and someone is selling
it on Dantooine, you can offer a delivery fee for someone to bring it to you.
The only catch is that the person who placed the item for sale would have to
authorize the delivery, otherwise you could have people griefing merchants by
having their products shipped to undesirable locations.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
there would also be a new button next to the &quot;My Sales&quot; button on the
Bazaar terminal -- this would be labeled &quot;Wanted&quot;. Pressing it would
allow you to create what would essentially be want ads. You'd enter text into
two fields: a short Subject line (probably with something like a 30-character
limit), and a Details text entry box. You'd briefly describe what you want to
sell (or buy!) in the Subject line, then provide any other necessary
information in the Details box. When you hit OK, this would create a new
&quot;item&quot; that's only shown when you click on the &quot;Wanted&quot;
category on any Bazaar or Shipping terminal. All Wanted items would
automatically have, say, a 3-day lifespan, but you'd be able to cancel Wanted
messages in a way similar to how you cancel sale offers on Bazaar terminals
currently (the only difference being that you wouldn't get an actual physical
item to retrieve, since there was never one to begin with).</span></p>

EXAMPLE</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So how
would all this actually work? Let's try an example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Congratulations!
You're now the proud owner-operator of a YT-1300 -- she may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, and you're ready to start earning back what
you paid to buy her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You walk
into the Coronet Starport with your YT-1300 deed in your inventory. Set amid
the ticket stations are several new terminals -- they look sort of like Bazaar
terminals, but seem to have a few more blinking lights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You
access this new Shipping terminal, and click on the &quot;Resource&quot;
category. On the right side of the terminal screen, the usual list of resources
for sale appears... but you notice that there are two new columns: one for
&quot;Delivery Location&quot; that for some resources lists the names of
starports on various planets, and one for &quot;Delivery Fee&quot; that shows
some number. All the resources marked as having a Delivery Location also have a
Delivery Fee listed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
one item that shows a 500-credit delivery fee for taking some Radioactives to
Theed Starport. You were already thinking of heading that way, so you mark that
item and click on the &quot;Deliver&quot; button. You notice that there are two
other items whose owners want them delivered to the Shipping terminals at the
Theed starport, so you click on &quot;Deliver&quot; for them, too. Now all
three items are grayed out on the Shipping terminal display.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You deed
your ship, travel (uneventfully!) to Theed starport, and redeed your ship when
you get there. As you stand on your two feet again, you notice that your email
icon is blinking. When you click on it to bring up your Email window, you see
that there are three messages waiting for you, each one telling you that the
appropriate delivery fee has been credited to your bank account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;All
too easy!&quot; you think with a grin. Then you realize that while you were in
Coronet you could have checked the Wanted category for Bazaar terminals on
Naboo to see if there were any items you could have bought in Coronet to bring
to Theed in the hope of making a profit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You
figure you'll head back to Coronet, so you access the Theed Shipping terminal
and select the Wanted category for Corellian terminals. Someone is looking for
Lokian leather; someone else wants as many crates of Muon Gold as you can offer
(but you're not desperate enough to try smuggling spice -- yet); and -- hey!
someone wants Nabooian Fiberplast. You click on the Resources category, and
sure enough, someone is selling 1000 units of high-quality Nabooian Fiberplast
for 6000 credits. That seems a bit steep, but the person who left the Coronet
want ad says he'll pay 8 credits per unit. That would be a 2000 credit profit,
which would definitely pay the electric bill for a few days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So you
buy the fiberplast (before someone else can) and send an IM to the guy who
wrote the want ad -- no response. You send an email, then jump in your ship and
head back to Coronet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When you
get there, there's still no reply to your email. Now you have to make a tough
choice -- do you hang on to the fiberplast in the hope of selling it to the
person who wrote the want ad? Or do you put it onto the Coronet Bazaar yourself
to try to make back what you paid for it (and maybe a little profit in the
bargain)?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Limit
the number of items that can be concurrently taken for delivery. We don't want
someone coming in and taking every single freight item from a Shipping terminal
-- would 5 items (no more than 2 from any one terminal) be enough?</span></p>

Delivery from Bazaar terminals. Suppose you're using a regular Bazaar terminal
in a player city with no starport. Does that mean you can't offer an item for
delivery (since there's no way to pick which Shipping terminal the item should
be shipped from)? Should the rules for how items are deposited be changed so
that you could pay a fee (in addition to the delivery fee you're offering a
freighter captain) to have your item transferred to the nearest starport's
Shipping terminal when you put it up for sale on your Bazaar terminal? Or
should we make players have to go to an actual starport Shipping terminal to be
able to mark items for delivery to other worlds?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. NPC
delivery missions. We want to be careful with these. If it's just a matter of
delivering freight, it would probably be OK to have &quot;fake&quot; items to
be delivered from one planet to another -- freight items (per my original
suggestion) are never tangible items; they're just marked on a ship's manifest.
What we don't want is NPC <i>cargo</i> missions, since that suggests that
there'd be NPC-created items on Bazaar/Shipping terminals that we could
actually purchase... which would corrupt the entire player-crafting economy of
SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>4.
Smuggling. This probably deserves a thread all to itself! I've never played a
Smuggler, so I don't know how this profession currently does its thing. But
given the hugely iconic nature of Han Solo's character to the Star Wars
literary universe, I can't imagine that the developers don't have some new
features in mind for Smugglers in a post-<i>Jump to Lightspeed</i> world. So I
don't want to go too crazy with suggestions here, but it certainly seems that
smuggling ought to be involved somehow in shipping as I've described it so far.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My
suggestion is to have Imperial ships in space be able to scan freighters (in
normal space). Imperial ships within a certain distance would be able to
&quot;see&quot; your ship's manifest. If you were carrying something illegal,
that would give you a TEF to them and they'd be able to attack you. Or perhaps
Shipwrights will be able to craft smuggling holds on certain ships
(*cough*freighters*cough*) -- smuggled items wouldn't show up on your ship's
manifest, but Imperial or Rebel ships that got close enough to your ship and
had the necessary sensors (see my thread &quot;Sensor Ops and You&quot; in this
forum) could perform a cargo scan. If the scan turned up any items that weren't
on your manifest, or that were obviously illegal, or if the scanning ship was
Rebel and the scanned items were clearly pro-Imperial, boom -- TEF time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
actually mistyped my post earlier, I should have written “buy orders” not “sell
orders”. Essentially the problem I see is that if players are given the ability
to say “Hey I want this item, I’ll pay you this much, have it delivered to me”
is that you’ve now put every store out of business. You underestimate how lazy
people can be. Once a system is put into place to allow people to request items
they want it’s all they’ll use, especially with how frustrated people already
are about empty vendors, small selections, etc, etc. That’s why I say it’ll
kill the Merchant profession.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now that
being said, if you’re instead talking about a player buying an item from a
bazaar that’s located on another planet and <b><u>then</u></b> saying that
they’d like to have it shipped to their current location, that I could see
working because it’s fostering additional player involvement without taking it
away from someplace else. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's be
clear about what I'm suggesting here. I'm proposing two new features: 1)
delivery as freight of an item from a starport Shipping terminal on one planet
to a starport Shipping terminal on another planet, and 2) delivery as cargo of
an item that someone requested in a Want Ad into the Bazaar terminal where the
ad was placed (which would include Shipping terminals).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Even
assuming that a Want Ad system designed to promote interplanetary cargo
shipping would additionally be used by some people to to try to avoid having to
walk around to find desired goods (and I agree that it would), I don't think
there'd be as much damage done to Merchants as you suggest. In the first place,
just being able to ask for something (as in a Want Ad) doesn't imply that
you'll always get it -- people will still have to get up and go looking for
some things from time to time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In the
second place, why is it good for players to be frustrated by having to walk
around for hours only to find empty vendors? If players can use the Want Ads to
post a message saying, &quot;Bring Item A to me personally and I'll pay you X
credits for it,&quot; how is that worse than the current pointless searching of
vendors, some of which will be empty?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
and most importantly, we currently have the situation of people going to the
nearest Bazaar terminal to look for Item A, but never finding it because no one
realizes that someone wants that item. A terminal-based Want Ad system would in
fact <i>expand</i> economic activity by allowing sales that would otherwise
never happen. Far from putting Merchants out of business, it would expand their
sales opportunities. The ability to easily see what people actually want
(instead of spending the resources to make a bunch of things most of which no
one ever buys) would make Merchants <i>more</i> profitable, not less.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Failing

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Of
course, that does nothing to prevent someone from simply buying an item from a
shipping terminal and placing it in their personal inventory, getting on a ship
and going somewhere else, then placing that item for sale on another shipping
terminal. So maybe this is another place where we need to make the distinction
between freight (something you ship for someone else but that doesn't belong to
you), which could use the terminal-&gt;manifest-&gt;terminal system, and cargo
(something you buy yourself and take elsewhere to sell at what you hope will be
a profit), which people will certainly transport in their personal inventory.</span></p>

point was that online games, including SWG, are basically stuck at a
prehistoric level of economic activity. If you think about it, about all we can
do are make one-shot deals with each other, either through the Secure Trade
Window or Bazaar/vendor terminals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And isn't
that similar to the limits to economic activity in the 1800s, when you pretty
much only did business with people you knew personally and/or locally? When there's
no reason for you to trust some distant person, why do business with that
person?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
vendors, Bazaar terminals, and Secure Trade Windows are all extremely valuable
economic tools in SWG because they are sufficiently trustable to allow players
who don't know each other to trust each other in business deals. But are they
enough to really unleash the creative potential of players who enjoy making
business deals with each other?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To
encourage more advanced economic activity in SWG, we need more advanced
economic features. I tried to imagine what the most important of those features
might be, and the most crucial concept by far was our notion of enforceable
contracts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The idea
that people can agree to some exchange, and that all parties to this exchange agreement
can trust the entire legal system of their culture to effectively enforce all
the (legal) terms of the agreement, is probably the single most crucial advance
in economic history. This is because an enforceable contract system allows
potential contractees who don't know each other to trust each other, because
they can trust the system to require the other person to hold up their side of
the deal. And that opens up more new economic opportunities than any other
economic tool we humans have ever dreamed up.</span></p>

I sort of would like to see a good, enforceable player contract system in SWG.

technically feasible. I think it is... but that question is better addressed in

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Good
point, Lasek. You're right; a freight delivery system would probably have to
have some kind of guaranteed delivery period. One day might be excessive; how
about two-hour delivery? If you haven't stashed it in the receiving terminal
within two hours, it's yanked out of your ship and restored to
&quot;available&quot; status on the shipping terminal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If we
really wanted to get complicated with it, we could charge &quot;overdue
fines&quot; -- every hour beyond the two-hour limit, you lose 20% of the
delivery payment. If the fines chew up all the delivery payment, then the item
goes back to the original shipping terminal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
still doesn't entirely address the problem of someone who takes a delivery item
but doesn't deliver it... and then keeps taking it, over and over again, just
to keep someone else from buying the item. If freight delivery is just NPC
mission stuff, no problem, but if we're talking about delivering player
freight, then that's a problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We
probably also need to have some kind of counter that &quot;remembers&quot;
whether you've taken some item, and doesn't let you select that particular item
for delivery more than once per day.</span></p>

The result for the shipper is a question, though: does he get a cut of the
