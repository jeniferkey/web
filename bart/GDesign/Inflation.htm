<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Inflation</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2005/10/11</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The first
thing to notice about faucet/drain economies is that there are actually three
things going on in them. There's wealth (in the two forms of items and money)
that enters the game through the &quot;faucet&quot; of mission payouts and
currency loot drops; there's wealth exiting the economy through the
&quot;drain&quot; (item destruction and things like taxes and service fees);
and there's wealth circulating in the game among players (people exchanging
money and items).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What's
important to see here is that only the faucet and drain matter when considering
whether inflation is occurring inside the game world. Money and goods
circulating among players do not contribute to inflation -- in fact, the more
of this that happens, the better for everyone in the game it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To
understand how the faucets and drains determine inflation, we first need to
agree on what &quot;inflation&quot; really is. According to economists,
inflation is the condition that occurs when the price of a broad array of
standard goods rises over time relative to the perceived usefulness of those
goods. Note that term &quot;broad array&quot; -- it means you can't just look
at the price of swords only, or at the prices of very rare items, to know
whether inflation is occurring. You have to consider the average price of
several different kinds of readily available goods. If that average price goes
up meaningfully over an extended period of time, then you've got inflation, but
not otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And just
to make life more entertaining, there's not just one kind of inflation -- there
are at least three.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Standard
inflation</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> is the
kind most of us think of; this is where a bunch of money enters an economy
while the number and quality of goods produced remain relatively constant. In
standard inflation, the value of an individual unit of currency decreases over
time for most available goods. If 10 dollars today is worth half of what it was
yesterday, then an item whose absolute value was generally agreed to be 100
dollars yesterday will cost you 200 dollars today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Demand-pull
inflation</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'> is the
next type. Suppose you have a fixed amount of money circulating in your
economy. Now, slowly cut back on the kinds and numbers of goods being created
in that economy, or add a lot of new people to the economy without also
increasing production. Over time, prices will generally increase as people
consider goods to be worth more (i.e., as demand increases because supply is
not keeping up with purchasing power). As prices rise for the same goods over
time, an individual unit of currency is worth less and less... and that's
demand-pull inflation. (This is something that can happen in a MMOG if crafters
are widely supplanted by loot drops for high-end objects, or if you irritate
your crafters so thoroughly that they quit your game and aren't replaced by new
crafters.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally, <b>cost-push
inflation</b> is what you get when the costs to produce goods rise generally.
This kind of price increase is usually caused by things like increased wage
costs (as through &quot;minimum wage&quot; increases or hikes in corporate
taxation) that are passed on to consumers. In games that don't support
corporations or that don't have corporate taxes applied by the system, this
type of inflation generally doesn't happen. But it can happen if crafting
requires natural resources, and the developers cut back sharply on the amount
or quality of those resources.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The most
common type of inflation in MMOGs is standard inflation. It shows up when the
amount of money being created in the game by players (doing whatever the game
allows them to do to make money -- usually running quests) exceeds the amount
of money exiting the economy in the form of taxes and fees. This can happen if
taxes and fees aren't set high enough to match the amount of money players are
creating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This can
also happen when there's a currency dupe exploit. If when these happen they
aren't corrected by changing the code (to stop the exploit) and removing the
money very quickly (so that innocent players don't exchange valuable goods for
&quot;dirty&quot; money), a game economy can inflate badly, possibly to the
point of ruining the game. So tools for tracking the creation, circulation, and
destruction of money in the economy are crucial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally,
not every MMOG winds up dealing with inflation. Another potential problem for
MMOG economies is deflation (sometimes called &quot;mudflation&quot;). This
occurs when valuable objects enter the game world and never leave while the
money supply remains relatively constant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Mudflation
tends to happen in particular as developers create high-level content. If
powerful items can be obtained more than once and/or can be transferred to
other players, then over time the price of low-level or average items of the
same type will decline as more of the high-end items enter the general economy
and trickle down to younger characters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note that
a major secondary effect of mudflation is to make many quests and mobs
irrelevant. When everyone can afford to buy very good items, there's no need to
loot mobs or do quests that yield less valuable items. For a developer, this
decreases the value of time spent developing low- to mid-level quest and mob
content because now users are able to complete this content more easily than
expected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Various
efforts have been made to combat mudflation. The concept of
&quot;soulbinding&quot; -- setting the &quot;no-drop&quot; and
&quot;no-trade&quot; flags on items -- is only partly to counter twinking; its
primary purpose is to prevent valuable items from entering the general economy.
Decay and damage effects also help reduce mudflation, though not as effectively
as soulbinding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The main
reason that both inflation and deflation are bad news for a MMOG is because
they alter the difficulty balance of the game, especially for new players.
Because new players have less money than established players, the value of
their money is significantly greater. So if new players are unable to buy
standard items because of inflation, the starting game will feel too hard. If
they are able to buy more items and more powerful items than the designers
intended for them to be able to own (due to deflation), their starting gameplay
experience can be too easy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In both
cases, these first impressions of a game can be the difference between a long-term
subscriber and someone who goes elsewhere to find a game that isn't too easy or
too hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Economic
design, monitoring and control matter.</span></p>
