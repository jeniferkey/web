<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For me,
the problems with Shipwright and Architect and other crafting professions not
being as &quot;fun&quot; as they should be come down to this simple question:
Why do people want to be crafters?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I think
for a lot of us it's the creative aspect. We don't make things because we enjoy
cranking out the same stuff over and over, or because we have some need to feel
useful to other players or to the game economy. We craft because we like coming
up with new things. We admire a clever invention; we enjoy a novel implementation;
we feel happy when we discover some new aspect of the game world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But how
are these interests served by the current crafting system in SWG?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It seems
to me that the developers who originally designed SWG's crafting system thought
of crafting in terms of its functional role in servicing the overall SWG
economy. That's not a bad thing; in fact, it's absolutely necessary to consider
this if you're going to have a true player economy (rather than an NPC-driven
economy).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But I
wonder if in designing SWG's crafting system the developers didn't spend too
much time thinking of crafting in terms of output, rather than in terms of what
makes crafting fun. To put it another way, it seems like crafting in SWG is
only about cranking out stuff for non-crafters, rather than being something
that people want to do because it's fun to do in its own right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In other
words, I think the real problem with all the crafting professions is that
they're designed to be all about result, and not enough about the process of
crafting itself as a creative act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Consider:
there are only a few types of houses and ships, and they don't decay -- once
you build (and sell) a house or a ship, it's around forever; there's no
aftermarket. This is fine if your main concern as a developer is to insure that
players who want houses and ships can get them... but from a crafter's point of
view, it quickly becomes unprofitable. Even worse, it becomes boring -- once
you've built one of the few predetermined types of houses or ships, there's
nothing new to discover; it's just about cranking out more of the same with
better quality... and once you've done that, what's left?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SWG's
crafting designers wound up putting a time limit on crafting. Crafting becomes
something that you do for a while until you realize that you've made everything
that can be made. Then you stop crafting because it's boring and unrewarding.
And the economy starts suffering from having fewer crafter-created goods. And
then SWG's administrators have to start adding more and better loot drops to
compensate for the goods that are no longer being created by people who stopped
crafting. And that further drives off crafters, and things just get worse from
there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In short,
crafting in SWG wound up being designed from a non-crafter's perspective. It
isn't about providing a feature that's fun for crafters; it's merely about
maintaining a supply of goods to non-crafters. We're just a cog in the economic
machine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The good
news is that this can be fixed. Crafting in SWG is not completely broken; there
are some very good structural features that can be built on. In particular, the
system of mining resources with varying qualities and using those resources in
schematics is brilliant -- it is the one truly great feature of crafting in SWG
that makes crafting worth doing for any amount of time at all. The concept of
experimentation on craftable objects, while limited, is also fundamentally good
because it supports the creative aspect of the natural crafter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What we
really need is to recraft the crafting system in general using the existing
structural features to focus on making the process of crafting interesting and
fun. When people craft because it's fun, you'll get necessary goods into the
player economy because people will want to craft. Result: happier players, and
a better (i.e., more profitable!) SWG.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I've had
a few ideas for how to accomplish this goal -- see my <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=csystems&amp;message.id=18597">Crafting:
A Blueprint for the Future</a> and <a
href="http://forums.station.sony.com/swg/board/message?board.id=architect&amp;message.id=49394">Modular
Architecture: A Redesign Proposal</a> posts for examples. But the main thing is
to realize that Shipwrights and Architects and other crafters will continue to
get bored with crafting as long as crafting remains designed to service
non-crafters instead of being a fun process for crafters themselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If we
ever get anything like a Crafting Revamp, I hope the developers assigned to it
will understand this concern, and will think of ways to restructure the
fundamentally good crafting system to emphasize the process of crafting from
the point of view of those of us who enjoy the act of creation. That, I think,
is the ultimate solution to the Shipwright problem.</span></p>
