<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2007/05/25</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;And
when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no new
worlds to conquer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(The
benefits of a classical education. ;-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Looking
around at the MMORPGs out today and in development, gamers can be forgiven for
thinking that every possible style of game has already been invented. Fantasy,
science fiction, and superheroes rule.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Naturally, some
people can't resist trying to escape from these increasingly sterile forms. That's a
good thing... but I wonder if we're trying hard enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The idea
of just suggesting some relatively untried genres seems pretty obvious.
Hard-boiled &quot;noir&quot; mystery, rival Mafiosi families... these genres
will probably occur to most people once they get past &quot;Western gunslinger,&quot;
&quot;Pirates,&quot; and &quot;Post-apocalyptic.&quot; SOE’s recent
announcement of &quot;The Agency&quot; is testing the
sharks-with-lasers-infested waters of spy thrillers. And David Perry’s &quot;Top
Secret&quot; multiplayer racing game is an interesting experiment in
participatory development. But there are other possibilities worth
exploring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A pure
genre idea I keep coming back to is pulp adventure, such as Edgar Rice
Burroughs's &quot;Barsoom&quot; (Mars) novels. Four-armed green Tharks with
swords and bad attitudes; sky pirates armed with radium pistols; gorgeous (or
hunky, take your pick) red princesses (or princes) of Helium; and players whose
characters come from Earth are able to leap tall buildings in a single bound
because of the lower gravity of Mars. I think the copyright on these novels may
even have expired... so why has a game based on this not been made yet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That said,
I think just playing with genres will soon prove to be a dead end. The literary
forms of the past will be played out at some point. Instead, what about stepping
out of the box a little further to look at possibilities that only online worlds
can offer?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What if
instead of making yet another Hobbesian, zero-sum, red-in-tooth-and-claw
competitionfest someone made a game where competition was subordinate to
cooperation, where players could choose to work together at a high level?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>An idea
in this style I came up with a while back was what I called the &quot;Big
Challenge&quot; game. In this kind of game, the developer creates a detailed
world, then sets -- wait for it -- a Big Challenge, then unleashes players on
the game world. To &quot;win&quot; the game, players would have to work
together to achieve the high-level goal, the Big Challenge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
example of this sort of thing I came up with was writing code to simulate a lot
of physical phenomena and processes -- matter, energy, chemistry,
electromagnetism, gravity, biochemistry, photosynthesis, respiration, etc. --
and then stock the Earth of about A.D. 1750 with all kinds of natural resources.
I'd then open it up to players and say, &quot;Your challenge is to create a colony
on the Moon that is self-sustaining for 100 people for six months. Go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Players
would then be able to work together to discover the processes and build the artifacts
that allow travel and survival in the harsh void of space and on the surface of
the Moon. They could form groups (such as corporations) that might compete with
each other to reach some technological milestone first, but no one group would
be able to do it all -- only through cooperating at a high level could the
ultimate goal be achieved, at which point everybody who contributed wins.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And when
that happens (probably sooner than I expect), I'd be ready with the next Big
Challenge: colonize Mars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then:
Colonize the asteroid belt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And then?
The stars are waiting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is there
really no place for a game like this? Is the thoughtful, helpful, decent side
of human nature unworthy of gameplay? I don't believe that... but where are the
games proving me wrong?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But now
let's step back even further. Here's a diagram I drew showing my personal
interpretation of the various forms of playful software we've invented so far and
how they interact to form specific modes of gameplay:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<img alt="Venn Diagram of Computer Game Modes" src="Venn-MMORPGs.png">

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When I
look at this diagram, I see the gaps. I immediately think, &quot;What if...?&quot;
What if the Adventure circle were expanded to intersect with MMOGs? Could there
be a massively multiplayer adventure game? What if the Strategy circle were
expanded to CRPGs, so that you actually played a character whose effectiveness
at strategic planning determined your character's story arc? What if the
Strategy circle were expanded to MMORPGs, so that gameplay wasn't just a bunch
of mindless one-on-one slapfights but represented hundreds of thousands of
massive empires spanning a galaxy?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What if
the Software Toy circle were expanded into Online games? (Oh, wait -- that's
Spore. Eventually. Maybe. ;-) OK, what if the Software Toy circle, with its
emphasis on simulation, were expanded into MMORPGs? Can you imagine a game
where the gameplay revolved around how well your characters responded to
dynamic but comprehensible changes in complex systems? What kinds of complex
systems would be fun to simulate if you could allow thousands of characters to
fiddle with the switches and dials?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You get
the idea. We're out of ideas? No new worlds to conquer? Baloney!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There is a wealth
of novel gameplay modes just waiting to be invented. And that can happen as
soon as we're ready to step back and see the big picture, when we pop out of the
frame of our assumptions so that we can identify the old conventions that are
ripe for being challenged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That
doesn't mean throwing out everything. It means using the basic elements of
gameplay in new ways.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>All it
takes is for somebody to try it and see what happens.</span></p>
