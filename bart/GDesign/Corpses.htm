Corpses</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/04/06</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As I was
playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion the other night like everyone else, I
got to wondering: What if corpses didn't vanish in MMORPGs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Early on
in the game, I was circling Imperial City to map out dungeons to explore later.
One night, I came across several NPCs on horseback on a bridge to the south of
the city. OK, mildly interesting, chat briefly with Herminia Cinna and someone
else, no big deal, move on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The next
night, while searching the waterline for Nirnroot plants, I happened to walk
underneath that same bridge... and there, sprawled out under the bridge, was
the dead body of Herminia Cinna. Apparently she'd hung around the bridge too
long and been cut down by a bandit without being able to escape in time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
several reasons, I felt bad about this. For one thing, in the game world, a
presumably &quot;good&quot; (or at least weak) NPC had died. Because Oblivion
is a single-player game, that meant this NPC was gone for good. Someone who'd
probably been an innocent had been cut down forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For a
less noble reason, I felt bad because Herminia Cinna could have wound up being
a quest-giver. Now that she's dead, I'll never know whether she had a quest for
me or not, and if she did, I'll never be able to experience that game content.
(Not in my current incarnation, anyway.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And for
the least noble reason of all... I stripped her body bare. I took all her stuff
-- it's not like she'd need it any more -- including a very nice magical ring
and a key to her house (which, once I find it, I'm going to plunder). And I
left her unclothed corpse lying beneath the bridge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>From a
pure gameplay advantage point of view, there's no reason why I shouldn't have
done this. As far as I can see, there'll be zip-point-zero negative
consequences; in fact, at a minimum I got a nice magic item out of it. I'd have
been crazy not to exploit the situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And
yet... it bothers me. At the time, I didn't know I could move bodies. As far as
I knew, I couldn't do anything with the corpse like bury it, cremate it, or
even dump it in deep water out of sight. I couldn't even build a cairn to
enclose the body and mark its resting place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So
there's nothing respectful I can do toward Herminia Cinna's body to rationalize
to myself the acceptability of taking her stuff. And I feel strangely
uncomfortable about that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Is it
silly/odd of me to have this reaction?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>More to
the larger point, is there a lesson here for MMORPGs? Suppose for a moment that
when you kill a character -- either an NPC or a player character -- the body
doesn't magically and mysteriously vanish. Suppose bodies hang around as
objects until/unless they're disposed of (by carrion-eaters in the field, or by
undertakers in a city). Would this affect your in-game behavior?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What if
there were game consequences for how you treat bodies? Imagine a multiplayer
game with the following features:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>there's
     a special magical skill that can be used (by players or NPCs) to
     &quot;see&quot; who killed a character</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the
     more time that passes between a character's death and the discovery of
     that character's body, the lower the percentage chance of being able to
     identify the killer</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>you
     lose faction points with whatever faction the dead character belonged to
     if someone is able to identify you as the killer of that character (or if
     a character belonging to the same or closely allied faction actually sees
     you in the act of killing that character)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>you can
     move bodies</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>bodies
     float after three days (game time)</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>bodies
     decompose after a week (game time)</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Setting
aside for a moment the issue of frame rates dropping as more high-poly bodies
start piling up, consider instead the effects on gameplay of these features.
How would gameplay change if dead bodies didn't mysteriously vanish, and if
your character could be linked to corpses?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>For
example, I can imagine this leading to the creation of an &quot;inspector&quot;
NPC type -- based in the larger cities, they travel around examining any dead
bodies that are discovered to try to identify who the killer was. (For that
matter, why not let player characters do this, too?)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So what
else might happen? Would these features make the game world more
interesting/fun? Are there particular kinds of game worlds that rules like
these would be most suitable for? Or would such rules always annoy too many
players who just want to kill any/all NPCs and PCs indiscriminately with no
consequences?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>
