<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
writing an essay on the <a href="Economic%20Stages%20of%20MMOGs.htm">Economic
Stages of MMOGs</a>, I came up with the notion that online games would benefit
from providing more ways for players to interact economically. This idea of
&quot;player contracts&quot; seemed like a particularly worthwhile idea to
explore, so I've developed that idea further here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A secure
contract is an agreement between players to exchange items of value that is
enforced by the game system. This document will describe a design proposal for
implementing this concept within Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and
detail the reasoning supporting the proposed implementation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>WHY
SECURE CONTRACTS?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I go into
the &quot;why&quot; in greater depth in the Economic Stages of MMOGs essay, but
in a nutshell: virtually all MMOGs are stuck in an economic Stone Age because
they don't offer the necessary in-game systems to support more advanced
economic action. Goods and money can be traded in one-shot deals, but that's no
better than Og the Caveman could accomplish. A more advanced economic system in
MMOGs is desirable because it would deepen the playing experience, not just in
the obvious form of allowing more competitive and cooperative player
interactions, but also by expanding the range of economic opportunities
available to all players (in the same way that advanced economic systems in the
Real World offer economic opportunities to individuals that would otherwise be
unavailable). Therefore, identifying and implementing more advanced forms of
economic activity in MMOGs is desirable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Several
key in-game systems need to be designed and implemented to permit an advanced
online economy. One of these is a system of cheat-resistant player-to-player
trade contracts. Early MMOGs allowed players to exchange goods and money, but
these proved to be susceptible to several forms of cheating. The fear of being
cheated thus limited economic activity. To counter the most common cheats, the
Secure Trade concept was devised. By encoding trading rules that prevent the
twin scams of item misidentification and item substitution, a Secure Trade
allows players to trust each other when considering whether to exchange goods
and money. This increased trust encourages more economic activity than would
otherwise have taken place, which is the goal this proposal aims to deliver, so
it's worth examining the Secure Trade concept in more detail to see how this is
accomplished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As noted,
Secure Trades promote trust by protecting players from the two most common
trading scams. First, a Secure Trade Window shows item names and item
descriptions separately, using a game rule that allows players to set item
names but retains system-generated item description text. Displaying
system-defined item descriptions tells each player exactly what is being
offered, preventing unscrupulous players from selling items with
&quot;fake&quot; names. (For example, the description of an item can't read
&quot;+10 Healing Juice&quot; and just be a bottle of water. If it's just
water, the description of the item will say so no matter how the item is
named.) Second, a Secure Trade prevents the terms of a deal from being modified
after one person has agreed to the deal. As soon as one player accepts the deal
as offered, the only options are to accept or cancel the deal in its entirety.
This restriction prevents a player from replacing a good item with a piece of
junk after the other player has agreed to the original deal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These two
features of Secure Trades allow players to trust other players in exchanges
because they know they'll get what they think they're getting. It's still
possible to make bad deals on the value of the goods exchanged, but at least
players can trust that the system itself won't be used to cheat them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But it's
also true that Secure Trades are limited in two important ways. First, they
only let players trade goods and money. That's fine as far as it goes, but what
if I as a player want to offer a service to another player within the game? How
can we trust each other to keep the terms of an informal agreement when there's
no system-controlled enforcement of those terms? Second, Secure Trades are
one-shot, immediate deals. They don't allow a player to establish an ongoing
business relationship with another player by creating deals that happen in the
future, or that happen more than once. Again, such agreements can be and are
made informally in active MMOGs, but not as many as might be made if players
had access to a game-controlled mechanism for enforcing the terms of trade
agreements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Still,
the Secure Trade system, while limited, does work. That makes it a good base on
which to attempt to build a more advanced trade system in which a single
exchange of goods and money is just one type of player-to-player contract
within a general contract system. Secure Trades increased economic activity by
establishing trustability in simple exchanges; Secure Contracts can increase
economic activity yet again by expanding the number and types of trustable
interactions that can occur. The rest of this document will discuss specific
elements of a Secure Contracts system for use in MMOGs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>SECURE
CONTRACTS OVERVIEW</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This design
defines a Secure Contract to be a general trade agreement between two players
whose terms are enforced by the game. Player A (the &quot;contracting
player&quot;) agrees to provide goods or money to Player B in exchange for
Player B (the &quot;contracted player&quot;) agreeing to provide goods, money,
or a specific service to Player A. (Exchanges of money for money would not be
allowed, of course, unless a MMOG offers several different currencies and wants
to allow arbitrage.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Two modes
of secure contract are possible in this system: the Personal Secure Contract,
negotiated iteratively in real time between two players whose characters are
within a certain minimum &quot;physical&quot; range of each other, and the Open
Secure Contract, specified by a contracting player but publicly available for
acceptance by any player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Before
the mode of a &quot;live&quot; contract is set (determined by how the
contracted party receives the contract offer), it might be useful to generate
&quot;draft&quot; contracts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>THE
DRAFT SECURE CONTRACT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Any player
would be able to generate a draft Secure Contract. A click of the appropriate
button would cause the Secure Contract Window to be displayed on the player's
screen. She would first select the desired contract type from a drop-down list.
Once a contract type is chosen, the terms specific to that contract would be
displayed and the possible options within each contract term would be
selectable. When the values of the initial contract terms are set to the
player's satisfaction, she could set the contract aside in her inventory for
later use. If she subsequently offers the draft contract to a nearby active
player who agrees to the terms, the &quot;live&quot; contract is created at
that time as a Personal Secure Contract. If instead she offers the draft contract
to some form of game-controlled public system for retaining and displaying
potential contracts, then once another player agrees to such a contract it
becomes an Open Secure Contract. If a player who is offered a draft contract
rejects it, or if the player who created a draft contract retrieves it
unaccepted from a public contract display system, then this contract returns as
a draft Secure Contract to the inventory of the player who created it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note that
for technical reasons it might be undesirable to allow players to generate and
retain draft contracts. In this case the mode of contract a player generates
(Open or Personal) would be determined by the means of generation. A Personal
Secure Contract would be generated by offering a contract to another player, with
all contract terms negotiated in the Secure Contract Window at that time. An
Open Secure Contract would be generated by offering a contract to a
&quot;contract terminal&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot; or some other
game-controlled public contract provider appropriate to the game milieu. The
player offering the contract would be able to set all applicable contract terms
in the Secure Contract Window until the contract is offered to the public
contract provider.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In either
case, if the player making the contract offer will be providing actual money or
goods as payment, then the full value of the payment (for each time the
contract is activated) must be transferred from the contracting player’s
personal inventory, bank vault, or bank account into the contract’s
&quot;payoff account&quot; container. This requirement will insure that the
contracting player is actually able to make the deal being offered, which will
help reduce the number of frivolous contract offers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>PERSONAL
SECURE CONTRACTS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
contracting player of a Personal Secure Contract would begin a negotiation by
offering a contract to another nearby player. If the other player accepts the
offer to negotiate a contract, the Secure Contract Window is displayed on both
players’ screens. The Secure Contract Window would initially offer a choice of
contract type. When a particular contract type is selected, the contract terms
specific to that type of contract are displayed, possibly with some default
settings selected. The contracting player would set the initial terms, then the
contracted player would then have an opportunity to alter the terms of the
contract. The contracting player would then be able to alter the terms again,
and so on. This process of iterative negotiation would be allowed to continue
until one player cancels the contract offer or both players explicitly agree to
all the terms. Note that, as with the Secure Trade Window, once either player
has indicated agreement to the terms displayed in a Secure Contract Window, the
other player may not alter any of the terms -- the only options available at
this point are to accept the contract as-is, retract the conditional agreement,
or cancel the contract offer entirely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Among the
terms that both players may negotiate are the specification of what will be
exchanged and in what quantities, when exchanges will occur, whether either
party can cancel the contract without penalty, and (optionally) any penalties
for canceling a contract or otherwise failing to meet the terms of the
contract. As noted above, the contracting player would initially be required to
transfer to the contract the full amount of goods or money being offered for
exchange. If the deal is a simple swap of money for goods, the contracted
player would then enter at least one unit of some good currently held in his
personal inventory into the contract's &quot;provision account,&quot; then
specify the number of units of this good to transfer each time the contract is
activated. (Requiring at least one unit of a good to be put into any contract
account is necessary to avoid forcing players to choose from a gargantuan list
of all possible goods. Not only would this be a complex data structure to store
and display, it might reveal some resource details a little too conveniently.)
Optionally, both players could also enter some amount of money into a
&quot;penalty account&quot; if there is to be a penalty for failure by either
party to adhere to the terms of the contract.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>OPEN
SECURE CONTRACTS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Although
the contract system was originally envisioned as allowing two players to
negotiate contracts together in real time, the system could be extended to
allow what I call Open Secure Contracts, that is, contracts created by one
person and placed in some public location (probably a &quot;contract
terminal&quot; in SWG). Other players could browse the list of contract titles
from the public contract provider, then examine the details of a specific
contract whose title sounds interesting. Note that to prevent two players from
taking the same contract, as long as a contract’s title is visible to one
player it should not be displayed by any other contract provider list. If the
player reading the open contract likes all the terms as stated by the offering
player, he would agree to them and the contract would go into effect between
those two players (with appropriate contract documents provided to both
players). If the proposed contract isn't acceptable, the player reviewing the
details simply cancels and the contract is restored to public availability. In
essence, an Open Secure Contract is simply a publicly available contract to
which the contracting player has already agreed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
downside of this approach is that the contracted player wouldn't be able to
alter the terms of the contract; his only choices would be to accept all the
terms exactly as laid down by the contracting player, or else to reject that
contract entirely. But the standard two-way negotiable Personal Secure Contract
would still be available to players who prefer to haggle over terms. Allowing
open contracts would merely expand the scope of contract availability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>[Note to
SWG players: Actually, I'm a little embarrassed to say this but it seems to me
that there's another name for an open contract system: &quot;player
missions.&quot; It's not what I meant to design, but it sure looks like
functionality that would support player missions. Oops.] </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>ACTIVATING
A SECURE CONTRACT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As soon
as both parties agree to a contract, it takes effect. If both players have at
least one available slot in the appropriate part of their personal inventory, and
if the specific type of contract that was agreed to was not of the
&quot;immediate&quot; variety (defined below), then both players receive a
contract document as an inventory item. (In SWG, this would take the form of a
data file in the datapad.) This document lists the terms of the contract in a
read-only form.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Once the
terms of the contract are met and the contract is &quot;activated,&quot; the
goods or money in the contract's payoff account are transferred to the
contracted player, while the specified amount of any goods or money named in
the provision account are transferred from the contracted player’s inventory or
bank account to the contracting player's inventory or bank account. In the case
of an immediate contract (see below for the definition of an &quot;immediate&quot;
contract), this transfer occurs as soon as both parties agree to the contract.
Any goods offered by the contracting player are transferred from the contract’s
payoff account to the personal inventory of the contracted player, while any
goods offered by the contracted player -- in the amount specified by the
contract -- are transferred directly from the contracted player’s personal
inventory to the personal inventory of the contracting player. (This
approximates the current behavior of Secure Trades to remain consistent with
existing functionality.) Similarly, money is deducted from the payoff account
to the contracted player’s bank account, or directly from the contracted
player’s bank account (in the amount specified by the provision account) into
the contracting player’s bank account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>More
complex contracts would allow for multiple exchanges of goods and money (or
services) at specified intervals, and for exchanges that take place at some
time in the future from when the contract is agreed to. Money transfers would
automatically deduct the amount of money specified in the contract from the
offering player's bank account and add it to the other player's bank account.
Similarly, if goods are being exchanged the allotted number of specified goods
would be taken from the offering player's bank vault and placed in the other
player's bank vault. Note that non-immediate exchanges (that is, exchanges set
to occur some time after the contract is signed) use player bank vaults rather
than personal inventories to minimize problems caused by personal inventories
being temporarily full at the moment a future contract is activated. However, a
contracting player would still be required to put the full amount of goods or
money into the payoff account for the first exchange – again, this is to give
players who are offered contracts the reassurance that the offering player can
actually deliver on his promised payoff.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One
possible modification of this system would be to require that the contract
system automatically replenish the contents of the contracting player’s payoff
account each time the contract is activated (rather than taking goods or money
from the contracting player’s bank vault or bank account after the first
exchange). This would appear to automatically deduct goods or money from the
contracting player, and so might not be desirable. (Automatically crediting
goods or money is fine, but automatically deducting goods or money could lead
to player complaints if it causes too many contracts to fail due to insufficient
goods or funds.) It would, however, provide further assurance to a contracting
player that the contracting player is always able to fulfill the agreed terms
of a deal each time it is activated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In all
cases, if at any moment of contract activation either player doesn't have
enough of the agreed-upon goods or money, or doesn't have enough room to
receive the provided goods, or in any way cannot provide or receive the goods
or money or service required by the terms of the contract, then that player
will have broken the terms of the deal. At this time any items in the payoff
and provision accounts are returned to their original owners (if possible), any
money in the penalty account is transferred to the bank account of the player
who did not fail to be able to give or receive money or goods (or is split
between the players if both failed to be able to give or receive the
agreed-upon goods or money), the contract documents are deleted from both
players' inventories and the contract terminates. Additionally, deleting the
contract document will constitute canceling the contract, and may under certain
circumstances (see &quot;bilateral contracts&quot; below) cause any penalty
money to be transferred to the player who did not cancel the contract.</span></p>

offer a reward for scouting out a given location. (This sounds easy... but in
SWG, what about sending an overt player to spy on some location deep within a
city of the opposing faction? Not so easy!) The Delivery contract would let you
pay someone to give a droid containing the plans for a terrible new Imperial

Contract A might be set up as an immediate+one-time deal -- you and the other
player swap goods or services or money once, and that's it. (This is the
standard Secure Trade.) Contract B could be a limited+one-time trade, in which
both players identify types and amounts of goods or money to be exchanged, but
the actual exchange does not occur until the selected time. (This could be
useful for selling resources you haven't gathered yet.) Contract C might be
made as a limited+recurring deal -- for example, you and the other player swap
the agreed-upon goods and money every 24 game hours until five game days have
passed, at which time the deal automatically expires. Contract D might be made
as an indefinite+recurring deal -- you and the other player exchange the
agreed-upon goods/services/money every 12 game hours until the end of time...
or until one of you defaults on the contract or manually terminates it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Unilateral
simply means &quot;one-sided&quot; -- one player may choose to end the contract
without the other player's agreement, and this won't cause the penalty (if any)
to be applied. A bilateral contract, on the other hand, would require agreement
by both players to terminate a contract without penalty. If Player A and Player
B agree to a bilateral contract and Player B terminates the contract without
Player A's consent, then any penalty would be applied against Player B as

VARIETY OF PENALTIES</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There are
two types of penalties that could be applied if one player breaks the terms of
a contract:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>monetary</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>bounty</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A
monetary penalty is a lump sum of cash given to the player who didn't break the
contract. When agreeing to the contract, both players agree to a total amount
of cash to be placed in a &quot;penalty account.&quot; Half of this amount is
deducted from the bank accounts of both players as soon as the contract goes
into effect to insure that the penalty can be paid if necessary. (If either
player has insufficient funds to cover the amount agreed to, both players get
an error message to that effect and the contract is not agreed to.) Once the
contract goes into effect, if one player breaks the terms of the contract, all
the money in the penalty account is transferred to the other player's bank
account and the contract terminates.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
optional penalty would be to subject the person who prematurely breaks a
bilateral contract to a Bounty contract that can be taken by a Bounty Hunter. Both
contractees would agree on a bounty amount, half of which would be transferred
from each player's bank account into the penalty account when the bilateral
contract is agreed to. As soon as one player breaks the contract, the original
contract is terminated; a Bounty contract (much like existing Bounty Hunter
missions in SWG) is created and becomes publicly available with the money in
the penalty account set as the reward; and the player who broke the original
contract receives a &quot;Bounty Flag&quot; (like a TEF, but handled separately
from a TEF). The first bounty hunter who kills the flagged player character
immediately has his bank account credited with the bounty from the penalty
account; the contract-breaking player's clone has the BF lifted (so that he's not
a perma-target); and the bounty contract terminates. (Note that other forms of
dying, such as being killed by a monster or NPC, do not remove the Bounty
Flag!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It would
be entirely up to the two players making the deal to decide whether they want
to apply a penalty at all. In other words, penalties would be optional -- if
neither player wants one, then they shouldn't be forced to have one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
contract system must be designed so that the game itself recognizes when the
terms of a contract have been fulfilled or breached. Leaving it up to players
to decide when the terms of a contract have been met would open the contract
system to subjectivity, which would effectively doom a contract system. If some
MMOG wanted to implement a game feature in which players could be lawyers and
judges, and thus offer some means by which to litigate contract disputes, fine;
otherwise the game system itself should be established as the ultimate
impartial arbiter of contract resolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
ability to detect the satisfaction of contract-related conditions is the
beating heart of the Secure Contracts system. The game absolutely must be able
to reliably detect when the terms of contracts have been met or breached. The
technical issues involved should be investigated to insure that this is
possible. As a starting point I believe such a condition-monitoring system
could be implemented as part of a &quot;contract engine&quot;; that is, as a
cluster of tightly-integrated code modules which would perform the following

two possible states for a condition: &quot;false&quot; (when a contract is
created), and &quot;true&quot; (when something in the game has happened that is
part of the terms of the contract). In addition, conditions themselves are
classified as either &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Contracts
themselves can have four possible states: &quot;open&quot; (when a contract is
waiting for conditions to be fulfilled), &quot;activated&quot; (when all
positive conditions in a contract become true), &quot;failed&quot; (when any
negative condition becomes true), and &quot;complete&quot; (when all positive
conditions in a one-time contract become true, or any negative condition
becomes true, or a unilateral contract is cancelled).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To be
clear about how contract statuses change: if when a contract's conditions are
scanned all positive conditions are true, set the contract's status to
&quot;activated&quot;; if any negative conditions are true, set the contract's
status to &quot;failed.&quot; The &quot;activated&quot; status corresponds to
successful fulfillment of a contract's terms, while a &quot;failed&quot; status
indicates that something has happened to make fulfilling the contract
impossible (that is, the terms of the contract have been broken). Certain other
conditions (canceling a unilateral contract) will simply set a contract's
status to &quot;complete&quot; without forcing either a successful exchange or
a penalty application.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>To see
how this would work, let's consider an example. Suppose a player accepts an
indefinite+one-time contract to destroy a creature lair. A Destroy contract
(let's say it's also a bilateral contract) is created and maintained in a list
of contracts. If the contracted player destroys the specified lair, the game
system must recognize this event and update the value of the positive
&quot;contracted player has destroyed lair&quot; condition for that particular
Destroy contract to &quot;true&quot;. Since this is the only positive
condition, the contract's status is set to &quot;activated&quot;; the terms for
successfully performing the contracted task are activated (that is, the
contents of the provision and payoff accounts are swapped); the entire
contract's status is changed from &quot;activated&quot; to
&quot;complete,&quot; and at the proper time the completed contract is deleted
from the contract list (and the contract documents in the inventories of both
players are deleted as well).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If (using
the same example) the lair despawns or ceases to exist for any reason other
than because the contracted player destroyed it, then this fact must be
signaled to the appropriate condition in the Destroy contract in the contract
list -- specifically, the value of the negative &quot;player cannot destroy
lair&quot; condition would be set to &quot;true.&quot; When this contract's
conditions are scanned, the contract's status would be updated to
&quot;failed&quot;; when contract statuses are checked any penalty terms
specified by that contract would be imposed on the appropriate player; the
contract's status would be updated to &quot;complete&quot;; the contract would
be deleted from the contract list; and the contract documents would be deleted
from the inventories of both contracting players. The same results would follow
if any other negative condition were met, such as (since this particular
contract was specified as a bilateral contract) if either player destroyed his
contract document. Had this been specified as a unilateral contract, destroying
a contract document would cancel the contract, which would activate the
&quot;contract destroyed&quot; condition causing it to be removed from the
contract list, but no penalty would be imposed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When a
contract's status changes to &quot;activated&quot; or &quot;failed,&quot;
either the payoff or (possibly) penalty -- as agreed to by both players -- is
applied immediately by the game system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When a
contract's status is checked and found to be &quot;activated,&quot; the results
of successfully fulfilling the terms of the contract will be carried out by
crediting the agreed-upon payoff to the contracted player. In the case of a
financial payoff, the money is taken from the contract's payoff account and
credited to the contracted player's bank account. In the case of a payoff in
goods, these are moved from the payoff account to the contracted player's
inventory or bank vault. If there is insufficient room in the contracted
player's inventory or bank vault (depending on which is appropriate for the
type of contract activated), or insufficient goods or money available to the
contracting player, then the contract's status is set to &quot;failed,&quot;
and it will proceed through the results of a broken contract (as described in
the next paragraph).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When a
contract's status is found to be &quot;failed,&quot; the identity of the player
who caused the failure is checked. Any goods or money in the payoff and
provision accounts are returned to their original owners (if possible), then
any penalty agreed to in the contract is applied. This could take the form of
money or goods placed in the penalty account being credited to the contracting
player, or if a bounty was agreed to the contract would revert to an open
Assassination contract and placed back into the list of active Bounty Hunter
contracts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I don’t
think the system described here is perfect. I wish there didn’t need to be specific
contract types; a more general contract system would capture more kinds of
economic activity. I’m not 100% sure that a game can detect all possible
contract conditions – I think it can be done, but I don’t know for sure. And I
do realize that implementing this system would require a lot of time and effort
– the detection of contract conditions alone would require that every class of
object that can be the target of a contract be made &quot;contract-aware,&quot;
for example.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But
having admitted these things, I’m still optimistic that the new game feature
I’ve described is both doable and worth doing. I think the technology will
support it, and I believe that any MMOG would be made a lot more fun by players
having more ways to interact economically with each other. This is especially
true for Star Wars Galaxies if (as I believe) the Open Secure Contract really
is the foundational technology for &quot;player missions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Great
feedback, Azton-Cobalt -- this is exactly the kind of thoughtful response I was
hoping to see. I'd been banging this stuff around in my head for a couple of
weeks, but there's just so far one person can go -- it was time to open this
concept up to other perspectives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First --
and most important -- is to respond to the &quot;degree of difficulty&quot;
question. This actually comes in two forms: one related to scope, and one based
on technical considerations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In terms
of scope, I recognize that what I've proposed isn't an overnight coding job. I think
I've managed to keep the design relatively simple (given real-world
considerations such as preventing griefing and exploitation, not to mention a
natural desire to add lots of &quot;wouldn't it be cool&quot; bells and
whistles), but there's no question that a player contract system that works
well will need time to get it right. I hope I didn't come across as naive about
that. I think we're looking at a system that is approximately of
&quot;vehicles&quot; complexity -- somewhere between adding a new structure
type and adding the Space Expansion. Actually, I suspect that the majority of
the time necessary to implement a contract system as I've proposed it would be
spent not in coding, but in testing -- making sure it works and is fun, but
isn't buggy or exploitable or griefable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Second is
the question of technical difficulty, particularly concerning what I called the
single most important technical issue: reliable detection by the game itself of
contract fulfillment conditions. Here I think I can provide some cause for optimism
by pointing out that, if you think about it, SWG already includes a simple form
of this feature in NPC missions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A number
of my design features were taken directly from how NPC missions currently work;
which is to say, I'm piggybacking on existing functionality. When you take a
mission, the game has to:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>store
     that your character has taken a mission</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>create
     any waypoints in your character's datapad</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>create
     a mission details data item in your character's datapad</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>store
     the mission's success condition status</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>monitor
     the mission's success condition</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>set the
     success condition to &quot;true&quot; if a certain in-game event occurs</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>modify
     waypoints and reset mission conditions for multistep missions</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>credit
     your chararcter if the mission status condition is set to &quot;true&quot;</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>delete
     the waypoint and mission details data items when the mission is completed</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>delete
     the stored mission if you cancel the mission</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Again,
all this is <i>existing functionality</i> within SWG. I'm inclined to think
that my more general contract system has a good chance of being possible
technically because it resuses this existing NPC mission technology -- I don't
think I've proposed anything that isn't already being done (albeit in a simpler
form).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The only
significant new considerations I see are:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>new UI
     (Secure Contract Window) to be designed/implemented</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>many
     more types of game-detectable success/failure conditions</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>an
     order of magnitude more contracts (missions) and conditions to monitor</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>These aren't
trivial issues, but at the same time I can't see any technical reason that
prevents them from being possible to implement. The only really tricky one is
the scaling question -- how well will the game run if it has to keep track of
possibly 10-100 times more contract information? Without knowing more about how
SWG is actually implemented (C with some C++ core code? strong C++ objects
everywhere? procedural subroutine communication, or strongly object-oriented
message passing?) I can't answer this one, but my gut tells me that an
adequately efficient &quot;contract engine&quot; will make this possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Now, to
specific points you raised:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>I could imagine 2 players agreeing to trade thousands of credits
for units of a specified resource; only to have it shift minutes after the
contract was agreed upon. The system would have to be smart enough to contact
both parties else 1 player could spend hours searching and another waiting for
something that just will not happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Agreed.
There are two things for me to say here: first, each contract type should have
a broad array of game-detectable options, as this will be necessary to insure
that players can tailor contracts to acceptability. For example, a Destroy
contract to destroy a creature lair might need to be able to detect:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>lair
     destroyed</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>lair
     destroyed by contracted player</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>lair
     destroyed by another player</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>lair
     despawned for unknown reason</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>When a
Destroy contract type is selected from the Secure Contract Window, these
potential situations could be reflected in the terms of the contract, possibly
by radio buttons if well-defined, or by a dynamically-built drop-down menu if
dependent on other game conditions. The parties to the contract could then choose
which condition they wanted to have treated as the &quot;success&quot;
condition, and which conditions constituted &quot;failure&quot; conditions; any
conditions not explicitly identified could be treated as what we might call
&quot;acceptable&quot; conditions: the contract ends, but no penalty is
assessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Other
types of contracts would need to be similarly studied to identify the right set
of conditions to monitor, and to determine whether the game can efficiently
monitor them (both individually and in the aggregate).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

contracts and running from the BHs, rarely logging on, or even re-rolling
characters as a form of griefing. There would have to be some sort of
reputation count in place where if a player defaulted on a contract, did not
pay his way out, and was not brought to justice, that others would be informed
of this before they signed new contracts with the player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
been some talk whenever the subject of &quot;deals with other players&quot;
comes up of wanting a way to know whether the other potential party to the deal
is a bad risk. The usual model for how to do this is the &quot;eBay
rating&quot; model, in which buyers are given a rating by sellers and
vice-versa. The problem with something like this in SWG (or MMOGs in general)
is that some gamers would abuse the system. Because they don't stick around,
they feel free to lie; but those lies would typically be retained by a rating
system.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So the
eBay model wouldn't be a good idea for keeping track of players who can't be
trusted to honor contracts... but who says we have to use the eBay model?
You're absolutely right -- all we need is a simple &quot;number of contracts
broken&quot; counter, or possibly a percentage ratio of &quot;contracts
broken&quot; to &quot;contracts signed&quot; if we wanted to get fancy. This
number would be absolutely objective since it would be maintained exclusively
by the game system itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The only
negative I can imagine is that tagging every user of contracts with this
information would cause some players to not use contracts, due to a concern
that they would inadvertently break some contracts and be unfairly branded as a
&quot;contract-breaker.&quot; This is a perception issue and thus hard to
counter. One possibility would be to allow &quot;aging&quot; of contract
resolution data -- in other words, the contract counter only retains the most
recent 1-6 months of contract resolution results, so that if you have a run of
bad luck your &quot;broken contract&quot; number or percentage will eventually
recover. I'm not too enthusiastic about that option, but it would be possible
if enough players found it acceptable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Another
option would be to allow players to explicitly specify which contract
conditions should be treated as &quot;no-fault&quot; failure conditions. That
is, the Secure Contract Window would list every possible condition relevant to
a particular contract type, then the parties to that contract would be able to
negotiate which one of three categories that condition should fall into for
contract resolution:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Success</span></li>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Acceptable</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If all success
conditions become true, the contract is activated. If any failure condition
becomes true, the contract is terminated and any penalty provisions are
applied. And if any acceptable condition becomes true, the contract is
terminated but no penalty is assessed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>As long
as the list of possible conditions relevant to a contract type is sufficiently
extensive and detailed to allow players to feel that they can craft contracts
to be fair to both parties if something goes wrong, then the value of having a &quot;broken
contracts&quot; counter (for identifying the bad risks) should outweigh the
perceived cost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

interface, and type in a reward per unit number. The player could then dump a
few thousand credits in the machine to activate the contract. Others could come
along, read the contract, decide to accept, and would be paid for each unit of
the correct resource they dropped onto the interface.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I have to
admit that I have some reservations about this one. Specifically, I'm not sure
it's wise to allow many-to-one contracts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Imagine
writing a valuable contract (&quot;I'll give you 10 cr/unit for any Class 3
radioactive&quot;) and then plunking it down onto a contract terminal in
Coronet. There are known limits to what one player can mine. This allows a
contracting player to write a contract he can afford to fill (i.e., he's got
enough money to pay for whatever one person can bring). But if you open this up
to a theoretically limitless number of players, there's no telling how much
money the contracting player might be on the hook for! If he posted such a
contract and logged out, he could return to find that he now owned millions
units of junk class 3 radioactives, but was utterly broke. <i>Not</i> good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Unless
the contract was written so that the contracting player couldn't be considered
to have &quot;broken&quot; the contract if he didn't offer any money to someone
who brought in some amount of the desired resource, the contracting player
could wind up with a bad reputation for having left an unfulfillable contract
out there. At a minimum, there'd be a lot of unhappy players when this
&quot;Really Open&quot; contract got pulled after just a few minutes (once the
contracting player had all the Class 3 radioactive units he wanted).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Better, I
think, to limit contracts to two parties. The second party might only be
defined once the open contract is accepted, but I think &quot;predictability of
response&quot; is a sufficiently powerful justification for holding the number
of parties to a contract to two.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Note: One
of the possible enhancements to contracts I'm still mulling over is related to
another of the economic advancements I identified in my &quot;Advanced Online
Economic Systems&quot; message back in the late Discussion forum; namely, the
corporation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>My idea
for implementing player corporations was to allow a generalized hierarchical
organization. That is, you'd be able to create a structure that links players
in superior/inferior relationships, possibly even allow the creator of such
structures to name the various levels and groupings. This would allow the
creation not only of corporations, but of crafting guilds, entertainer unions,
paramilitary units, and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If this
is done, then it occured to me that it would be useful to allow the
identification of the player at the top of such an organization to create and
agree to contracts on behalf of that organization. This would give
organizations more effectiveness as it would dramatically increase the
&quot;purchasing power&quot; of the head of that organization as its
representative. (It also models the real-world treatment of corporations as
&quot;corporate&quot; entities nearly on a par with actual human beings before
the law in some specific areas, which could eventually have some interesting
gameplay potential.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But, as I

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Chaining&quot;
contracts could have some wildly interesting results. Heck, an entire business

playing <i>The Sims</i> is for <img border=0 width=16 height=16

interesting, how about contracts that don't merely chain to one other contract,

upward into a single master contract could be considered a business in and of
themselves -- you could actually sell an entire business by selling the master

into which anything (usually goods or money) can go: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Assuming there
was a way to allow purchased items to be transferred from a waiting Bazaar
terminal to a contract Provision Account (something I didn't think of but that
is an excellent idea), the contract would be loaded up in something like the
following way: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
Payoff Account would contain the 1000 credits you offer for delivering the hat.
The moment the contract is accepted this money would be transferred from your
bank account to the contract's Payoff Account. (If you don't have enough cash
in your bank account at that instant to pay off the deal, it never happens.
This helps increase trust in the system.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
Provision Account would contain the hat you purchased. Note that the player who
takes the delivery contract never actually has the hat itself as an inventory
item. It's considered to be &quot;stored&quot; in the contract's
&quot;inventory&quot; to which players don't have any access -- the system
itself automatically handles all transfers if it decides that a contract has
been successfully activated (or item/money restorals if it decides that a
contract has been broken). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
Penalty Account would hold whatever sum you and the contracting player decided
was fair as a penalty for failure to meet the other terms of the contract. To
insure you against having your time wasted, you could set the Penalty amount at
1,000 credits. To take the deal, a contracting player would have to put up 500
credits (and so would you). This money would be transferred from each player's
bank account the instant both parties agree to the deal -- this insures that
the penalty can and will definitely be paid if anything happens that breaks the
contract. Again, the point is to help players trust that the system will work
in their favor <i>as long as they intend to honor the contracts they sign</i>. </span></p>

 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the hat

     contract documents are deleted from both your inventories</span></li>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>But what
about those without honor? Well, if a contracting player decides that he just
wants to annoy you, several things happen the moment he breaks the contract: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the

 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>the hat
     in the Provision Account goes back to the Bazaar terminal from whence it
     came</span></li>

     1000 credits in the Penalty Account gets deposited into your bank account</span></li>

     contract documents are deleted from both your inventories</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In other
words, if a would-be griefer breaks your contract everything gets reset to
exactly where it was before you wrote the contract -- the hat is still
available to you and you're not out a single credit (since the 1500 you paid
into the Payoff and Penalty accounts is restored to your bank account). There
are only two differences: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You're
     out however many minutes it took for all this to happen.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
     griefer lost 500 credits and you've got them.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
obvious potential problem here is that a rich griefer could run around taking
contracts he has no intention of fulfilling. This is easily minimized: don't
let anyone become a contracting player for more than N contracts (where N is
some low number like 5 or 2). Player should probably be allowed to offer as
many contracts as they like, since the fact that they have to put up goods or
money in the Payoff account up front will tend to limit how many contracts they
can offer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>From the
griefer's point of view, the only practical result of griefing someone would be
that they themselves lose money nearly every time they break a contract -- the
griefed party wouldn't be out anything but a little time (during which they
were somewhere else doing other other things). I suspect this setup would tend
to limit griefage pretty effectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
