<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>One of
the problems with giving players new items is the desire to provide items with
meaningful utility. You want your players to ooh and aah over the new content,
and you feel you need to make the item useful to accomplish that. These are
worthy aims, but they're not the only goals you need to bear in mind. In particular,
it's important to consider how that item will fit into the game world that
already contains other items. How will your new item compare to existing items?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>More to
the point, why should players want to have your new item rather than one of the
existing items? At the same time, why should your players ever want any of the
old items again if your new item is clearly better?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If you
don't address this question of power balancing items, you'll wind up with
players all making the same choices, leading to homogeneity of appearance and
action that devalues the time and money you spent developing other content.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;But
how can this balance be achieved, Master?&quot; So glad you asked, Grasshopper.
;-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The key
is to explicitly and consciously design every usable item in the game to have
both advantages and disadvantages. For every characteristic that offers
something you want, there should be some other undesirable characteristic that
goes along with the good stuff -- for every benefit, there should be an unavoidable
cost.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The point
of this is to insure that there's not just one item that everyone takes because
it's the &quot;best,&quot; but that different items will be &quot;better&quot;
as environments and circumstances change. As long as you're careful to insure
that the alternatives are balanced -- that one class of objects is never always
clearly better than another class -- then you're creating a world of
&quot;interesting choices.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I should
add that while it's possible to have something of this effect using just
benefits, the effect is easier to produce when you can use both benefits and
costs. Having both of these increases the number of interactions that objects
have with their owner and the environment, which are what item usage decisions
are based on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The next
step is to apply this approach to the characteristics of both loot/reward items
and crafted items. Then when players create or receive an item, then can decide
which characteristic they care more about maximizing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>On
rereading this, it seems pretty abstract -- maybe an example would help.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Let's say
you've won a &quot;Developer For A Day&quot; contest, and you've decided you
want to offer a new class of crafting tools that have more effects on crafting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The first
step (from a functional point of view) is to think about what effects the
object will have. Just for the sake of discussion, let's say you decide that
the new crafting tools will have the following characteristics:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Each of
these characteristics would be a 0-100 result that modifies the baseline
result. That is, if a tool has an Assembly Effectiveness of 50, it doesn't do
anything to the basic assembly calculation; if it had an AE of 100, it would
add some nice amount to your chances of getting a great assembly result; if it
had an AE of less than 50, it would actually reduce your chances of getting a
desirable assembly result. (Note that you could use some other scale if you
wanted; &quot;0-100&quot; isn't the thing to focus on here.) (Also note that
you don't actually have to make &quot;undesirable&quot; mean &quot;worse
effects&quot; -- just preventing you from getting the best effects could seem
like enough of a disadvantage.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So if 50
is the &quot;no effect&quot; point, that allows you to assign &quot;desirable&quot;
(above 50) and &quot;undesirable&quot; (below 50) values to each
characteristic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Next, you
decide how you want to group benefits and costs. In this example, for crafted
tools I'd suggest giving Assembly Effectiveness and Experimentation
Effectiveness an inverse relationship, increasing Manufacturing Output should
significantly reduce Construction Speed, and increasing Construction Speed
should decrease the typical values of all three of the other characteristics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By
setting up these inverse relationships, you create a kind of item for which
there is no &quot;best&quot; form -- each player will decide which is best for
his or her personal needs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And it
doesn't stop there. Now you can also allow for a new kind of crafting tool that
is dropped as loot or as a quest reward. All the characteristics still apply;
what changes are the benefit/cost relationships. Maybe for a looted crafting
tool, you can get a great Experimentation Effectiveness but it always comes
with a very slow Construction Speed. Maybe a crafting tool presented as a quest
reward lets you crank out many more units than usual in Manufacturing Output
(and at an acceptable rate), but crafting items with that tool will suffer
significant penalties to Assembly Effectiveness and Experimentation
Effectiveness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>By
specifying that usable items will have multiple characteristics that have
meaningful in-game effects, and by further specifying that high values of one
characteristic will always be balanced by low values in some other
characteristic(s), you can balance the perceived value of items no matter how
they're provided.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This
seems like it might help to address the &quot;crafted vs. looted/quested&quot;
item quality concern in a way that doesn't undercut anyone. Is there a problem
with it that I'm not seeing?</span></p>
