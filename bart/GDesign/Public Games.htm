<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2006/05/15</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Should
there be a &quot;Corporation for Public Games&quot;? Do we need more public
media, and should games be one of those media?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I would
say no.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm not
persuaded that the US should be increasing its share of state-sponsored
broadcasting. A private, commercial mass media certainly has its problems, but
becoming a bureacratized institution like the BBC doesn't seem like an
improvement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I
question this proposal on two grounds: propriety and efficacy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&quot;Games
in the public interest&quot; sounds to me like &quot;the state should use its
power to tax workers because they won't voluntarily give me money for my
brilliant game.&quot; In other words, it sounds to me like yet another
impatient attempt to bypass the marketplace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If people
aren't interested enough in games that are good for them to be willing to buy
them, who here is arrogant enough to say that, well, these people don't know
what's good for them and what we really need is another public, state-run
bureaucracy to provide this service to them whether they like it or not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In a
nation founded on the principle that the power of the state should be limited,
is it appropriate to expand that power for any trivial purpose? What necessity
is addressed by allowing the state to compete with the private sector by
providing games that are (in someone's opinion) good for us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The
argument from efficacy is that even if the intentions are good, the results
will eventually wind up being not so good: power corrupts. Instead of trusting
the marketplace to do its thing, state-run media forcibly extracts money from
people so that a few elites can broadcast the messages they think the people
should hear. Eventually it becomes impossible to resist using that power to
push one's favored point of view. Moyers and Totenberg (not to mention the
BBC's anti-Bush editorializing) are merely recent examples of how state power
over communications channels can be abused; conservatives could just as easily
install their own mouthpieces.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Do we
really need more of that? It's all very well when the state favors your
political views, but how will you feel when you learn that your tax dollars are
subsidizing &quot;LimbaughWorld&quot;?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'm
skeptical. I don't think there is any general mandate requiring us to accept
being forced to pay for yet another bureaucratic agency; I don't think a public
game development institution in particular is justifiable; I don't think such
an institution would make games that people would want to play; and I don't
think such an institution would remain unpoliticized for very long (if at all).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>In
closing, please note that this is not some Philistinic,
torch-and-pitchfork-wielding, &quot;ban Big Bird&quot; argument. The question
isn't whether art is socially valuable -- it's whether government is the
appropriate or best source of such art.</span></p>
