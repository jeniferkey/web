<p class=MsoPlainText><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>MMORPGs and Combat, Part 1</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>2006/04/25</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>It's a well-established
military maxim that it's better to be on the offense than on the defense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Well, I don't know
about anyone else, but speaking personally, I'm tired of playing defense on the
subject of non-combat gameplay design. I'm tired of any gameplay other than
killing being treated like it needs to justify its very existence in
multiplayer games.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>As in real life,
cooperative, constructive, creative gameplay has a valid role in MMORPGs. Those
of us who value this kind of gameplay have repeatedly explained why we like it,
why it's good for online communities, and why current and upcoming MMORPGs need
more of it. We have explained multiple times that we want non-combat features
not to replace combat gameplay, but to stand alongside it so that they mutually
enhance each other for an entertainment experience that's more satisfying to
more potential subscribers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Why do we keep doing
this? Why do we keep allowing ourselves to be put on the defensive about a
style of gameplay that is at least as valid as competitive, destructive,
offensive gameplay, as though refraining from killing everything in sight was
somehow abnormal behavior?</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Enough. It's time for
combat gameplay to justify its existence... if it can.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

</span></div>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>There's an old story of
an experienced engineer who was brought in as a consultant to figure out why a
multimillion-dollar pump wasn't working properly. The engineer walked around
the pump for a few minutes, rapped it with his knuckles in a few places, then
took out a pencil and marked a small spot about halfway up and said, &quot;Put
a pressure fitting there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>His bill: $20,000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>When the pump owners
protested this fee for a few minutes' worth of his time, the engineer sent them
an itemized list of charges:</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<table class=MsoNormalTable border=1 cellpadding=0 style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'>
 <tr>
  <td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:.75pt .75pt .75pt .75pt'>
  <p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Making a pencil mark:</span></p>

  <td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:.75pt .75pt .75pt .75pt'>

  the mark:</span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>$19,999</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>They paid the bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:Verdana'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</span></div>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>The point of this story
is that practical abilities -- like making pencil marks, or being really good
at decapitating orcs -- don't have much value by themselves. They're mostly
useful when they are thoughtfully applied based on knowledge and wisdom about a
problem space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>So why in the world
should being a really good killer in a MMORPG be the highest-valued ability?
Why shouldn't the brawn take orders from the brains?</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Why shouldn't combat
exist as one tool among many for problem-solving, rather than being the primary
mode through which &quot;content&quot; can be experienced? Why shouldn't
killing be the &quot;alternate advancement&quot; mode that's available for
those who are too impatient to solve problems by some other means than brute
force?</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Why in the world should
a MMORPG with serious aspirations of being a AAA title focus most or all of its
character classes on combat gameplay? How is that design perspective going to
attract the many potential subscribers who are utterly turned off by the design
assumption that &quot;fun&quot; == extermination of all life?</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:Verdana'>Combat-oriented players
and combat-obsessed game designers -- you've got a lot of explaining to do.</span></p>
