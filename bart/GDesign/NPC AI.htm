<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>What do
NPCs amount to in most MMOGs?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>1. Mobile
loot bags. Pop them like piñatas! Repeat as long as you like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>2. Quest
dispensers. Push the button, out drops a quest pellet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3. City
decorations. Because the appearance of life is close enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Personally,
the impression I get is that developers, when pressured by the money people to
justify the costs of creature AI and motion capture sessions for player
character models, try to combine those two activities to claim that &quot;we'll
have amazingly realistic non-player characters!&quot; You've got the humanoid
walk cycles; you've got the mob AI... just slap on a coat of pre-scripted
conversational paint and bingo! Perfectly acceptable NPCs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Like I
said, the technological side makes it tough to give NPCs plausibility. But it
sure would be nice if someone gave it a serious try. Even if having
&quot;smart&quot; NPCs limited the number that could exist in the world, that
might be a tradeoff worth making.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Better to
have a few reasonably sensible-acting NPCs than a world full of sheep-mobs in
people clothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

</span></div>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It's not
that I don't like NPCs in MMOGs -- I just expect more plausibly sapient
behavior from something that looks like a sapient being. If NPCs can't act in a
plausibly intelligent way, it might be better not to have them. An NPC that
just stands there when a battle starts raging three feet away does more harm to
a game world than it helps. It's just not plausible behavior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Of course
that word &quot;plausible&quot; is open to interpretation. :-)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There's
been a lot of work done on game AI (by which I mean behavior, not pathfinding).
Will Wright referenced this in a Powerpoint presentation he gave that used his
upcoming Spore for examples. One of his points is that you can get plausibly
intelligent behavior out of simple systems. It's not necessary to spend years
and millions of dollars on an AI system for your game that brute-forces
apparently intelligent behavior -- there are ways to do it that rely more on
designing a simple system whose apparently complex outputs arise from internal
state-transitions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>(Again,
this isn't some recent breakthrough. John Conway was talking about it with his
Game of Life for cellular automata back in the 1970s, and the alife people have
been chattering about this approach to AI ever since.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>I'd say
you could probably get the job done in a MMOG with three key features:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The mob
     can express a range of appropriate actions (fight, run, barter, converse,
     etc.).</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The mob
     contains a few internal variables with multiple states.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>There
     are a few rules that define how states can change and which actions are
     triggered for each state.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>This is
probably close to the system most MMOG designers already use for NPC AI, of course.
The thing that puzzles me is why MMOG designers stop at just two or three state
variables and only two states per variable -- that's where the power of this
system resides! (Your homework assignment for today: &quot;deterministic finite
automata&quot; from the Compiler Theory branch of Computer Science. Great
stuff.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>At any
rate, I'd like to see a little more effort put into NPCs. They don't have to
act like players, but they do need to appear to have some plausible motivations
and behaviors or they really hurt the believability of the game world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Oh, and
on the subject of &quot;memory&quot; of quest completions and so on: Yes, it's
true that you don't have to actually store the memory of who completed a
particular NPC's quest with the NPC. You can store it in the player's records
in the database.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>The thing
is, &quot;completed quests&quot; probably get their own table, assuming the
game uses a relational database. From the storage perspective, there's no
difference between locating quest memory with an NPC or with a player -- the
fact of completing an NPC's quest still gets stored somewhere. And that stuff
adds up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Which
brings me to the larger point I was making (though not very well), which was
that it's always easy to say, &quot;Hey, I just want to add this one new table
for storing when players do [X].&quot; But every one of those tables gets
multiplied (in the worst case, which you have to prepare for) by the number of
players you have. Each individual new table (and the pointers to the records in
those tables) adds up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If a MMOG
designer doesn't take a hard position on the creeping accumulation of new
features that require more database storage, eventually it could start
increasing your storage hardware costs... and if it really gets out of hand,
you could wind up with performance problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So (I
conclude) every new feature has to be considered not just for its coolness
factor, but also for the storage cost (in addition to the development costs).
If the value of the feature is clearly worth the cost, OK -- but that question
has to be asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>If I seem
like I'm contradicting myself here, I sort of am. On the one hand, I'm
agitating for better NPC AI; on the other, I'm shaking my finger and warning
against feature creep.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>That's
what happens when you wear both a player hat and a wannabe game designer hat.
