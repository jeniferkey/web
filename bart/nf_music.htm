<H3>Overview</H3>

<BR>
<P>
In the study of art, music deserves a place of its own.  Where visual
art (except for kinetic structures such as mobiles) is naturally
apprehended all at once (even in three-dimensional forms such as
sculpture where not all parts are simultaneously visible), music
requires time as a framework on which to lay down its pattern.
<P>
It's a matter of bandwidth.  Where the human eye can receive an enormous
amount of information (shape, color, position, velocity) in a fraction
of a second, the ear is much more restricted in the complexity of
distinct information it can process in conjunction with the brain.  It
simply is not possible to represent so many distinct qualities all at
once in a static form such as most visual art.
<P>
So music must be dynamic.  It only makes sense when perceived with the
passage of time.  And this requires a different analytical perspective.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>My Views</H3>

<BR>
<P>
Much of what passes for music these days suffers from the same disease
as modern Art in the broader sense: it's all about the artist.
<P>
One example is what I call the "breathy little-girl-in-a-coffeehouse"
sound.  A few years back we started to hear female singers doing a sort
of stream-of-consciousness type song, generally offering some highly
poetic (and highly personalized) plea for the toleration of some
socially unacceptable behavior.  (This kind of rock'n'roll revolt
against social norms used to be handled by heavy metal groups.  But
because the music was so loud, you couldn't hear the opinions of the
lead singer... so, obviously, the music had to go.)
<P>
Suzanne Vega is one of the matriarchs of this style, but since then
she's been joined by Jewel and others.  Alannis Morisette seems to be
one of these in basic temperament ("I," "I," "I," etc.), but she at
least has talent beyond vocal tricks and self-promotion.  Her voice is
well-disciplined; she's got a great range, both in terms of pitch and of
volume.  But at least as important, unlike most of the other "Lilith
Fair" types, Morisette seems to care about more than just showcasing her
voice.  She actually shuts up now and then and lets the band play, just
as though she realizes that the most important thing of all is the
music.
<P>
It's almost listenable.
<P>
My own tastes run more toward music without words.  For some people, one
of the best things about music is the soloist; I'm more impressed by
music not dominated by one raging egotist.  This doesn't mean I can't or
don't appreciate individual skill.  I can and do.  I'm just more
impressed by someone who works _with_ the rest of the music instead of
insisting on always being out in front.  Consequently I prefer
symphonies to solos, choral works to opera, and New Age to Pop.
<P>
Another reason why I prefer my music depersonalized is that I tend to be
distracted when I'm writing (essays or software) by words I hear
sung.  So when I hit the music stores, I look for "music without words."
<P>
From the Continent, I like Vangelis, Jean-Luc Ponty, Jean-Michel Jarre,
Mike Oldfield, and Tangerine Dream.  Their old work is still fun to
listen to, but I find that much of the recent work of all these artists
is superb.  <I>Voices</I> by Vangelis is particularly good; it starts
off with a song that sounds like men at the oars of a galley ship--it's
refreshing to hear modern music that's more "manly" than the breathy
and whiny little-girl stuff.  It sort of reminds me of the old romantic
swashbuckler movies of Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  It's just
fun!  I like Vangelis's more recent work, <I>Oceanic</I>, too.
<P>
Also excellent are Mike Oldfield's latest works: <I>The Songs of Distant
Earth</I> strikes me as being what "world music" will sound like fifty
years from now.  <I>Tubular Bells II</I> is a fitting sequel to
Oldfield's virtuosic debut album.  All the original instruments are used,
reminding me of revisiting old friends, but the music is updated to a
happier major key.  <I>Voyager</I>, meanwhile, highlights still-strong
Celtic themes with new instumentations and richer accompaniments.  One
doesn't often hear bagpipes outside of Scottish/Irish settings (or
P.D.Q. Bach concerts), but Oldfield uses them to very good effect.
<P>
Another favorite source of music for me are the works on the Windham
Hill label and its imitators.  I first discovered these in my days as a
college radio DJ, and they were just what I had been looking for without
my even knowing it.  Namely, high-quality instumental music that could
be played in the background.  Distracting noises from outside could be
masked, allowing me to get all kinds of creative work accomplished.
<P>
One of the first examples I found of this type was by William Ackerman
(one of the founders of the Windham Hill label).  Ackerman's work often
features his fine guitar playing accompanied by various other
individual artists playing instruments from piano to violin.  Another
great example was the solo guitar work of Michael Hedges.  His playing
was astonishing; I still can't figure out how he was able to make one
guitar--even if it was double-necked--sound like two guitars being
played independently.  Sadly, Hedges died in late 1997 in a car
crash, but his music will always occupy a prominent place in my
collection.
<P>
Lately I've been enjoying the work of Mark Isham and Tim Story.  Isham
uses a computer to generate themes, then develops the ones he likes into
accompanied pieces.  Seeming to be going the way of Mike Oldfield,
<I>Vapor Drawings</I> and <I>Film Music</I> were fully instrumental, as
was <I>Tibet</I> (a perfect accompaniment to a cold, overcast day).  But
Isham's later albums, <I>Castalia</I> and <I>Mark Isham</I>, feature
more pop-oriented songs (that is, they're music with words).  The music
is still very good, even if not optimum for my "no words" needs.
<P>
Tim Story, meanwhile, is much more a minimalist.  Where Philip Glass
uses explicit percussion to create rhythm, Story's music derives its
rhythm solely from the melody line.  This gives it a much more "unified"
texture.  Where a piece of Glass might have you tapping your fingers in
time, a short Story is more likely to have you humming along without
your even noticing.  (And most of Story's songs are short; they average
about four minutes in length.)  I find it to be excellent background
music--very much like a musical score to my day.
<P>
Finally, I have to admit that, every now and then, even I get tired of
"user-friendly" music.  Sometimes I just want to rock the place.  When
that happens, Soundgarden is OK, or even Sex Pistols... but for that
real backbeat-driven gotta-dance feeling, it is my carefully considered
opinion that the single greatest rock-n-roll song ever performed is
Jerry Lee Lewis's classic piano-scorcher, "Great Balls of Fire."
