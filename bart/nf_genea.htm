<H2>Overview</H2>

<BR>
<P>
One of the important parts of the emotional side is relating to other
people.  A dedicated Idealist can and will take on a cause though no one
else agrees, but that won't prevent him or her from being any less
lonely.
<P>
One of the primary sources from which we learn our emotional habits is
the family.  While the "different drummer" sometimes causes Idealists to
reject their families (who "just don't understand"), those families are,
nonetheless, important.  Families are one of the wellsprings of
identity; one's roots matter.
<P>
One way to understand those roots is genealogy.
</P>

<BR>
<H2>
My Views
</H2>

<BR>
<P>
Knowing one's relationship with those who came before provides a
foundation for what may come after.  This is especially true for those
who are Idealists first and foremost; one's ancestors and ethnic
background are the basis for "identity politics" in which special
privileges are expected to pertain based on one's descent.
<P>
I don't hold to that notion, myself; I think individuals are responsible
for their own actions.  Nevertheless, I too feel an attachment to my
ancestors.  The basic elements of who I am were set in place by them; it
seems only natural to me to wonder how much of them is reflected in me.
<P>
One thing I've learned in researching my forebears is that virtually
<EM>anyone</EM> of European ancestry who digs long enough and deep enough
will unearth royal progenitors.  It's just not that uncommon.  Which
means that those who think they're somehow superior to others because a
couple of their ancestors wore a crown are just putting on airs.
<P>
Still, these royal names are among the best-known.  They provide a point
of commonality (so to speak) for independent researchers... and it's
sort of fun to be able to call someone a "cousin" because we share an
ancestor who died a couple of centuries ago.  So here are some of my own
ancestral lines which I consider to be "interesting."
</P>

<BR>
<H3>Ancestors of the British Royal Family</H3>
<A HREF="./GenBrit/gindexb.htm">British Progenitors</A>
<P>
A compilation of many of the different branches of European royalty that
came together over the centuries to become the current British royal
family.  A leisurely perusal of this file will turn up a number of
familiar names: Charlemagne, William the Conqueror, Lady Godiva, Henry
VIII, and the late Princess Diana all make appearances, for example.  But
there are also a few surprises, such as several links to Russian nobility
and even a link all the way back to a Roman consul.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>Ancestors of One Branch of the Robertson Family</H3>
<A HREF="./GenRob/gindexr.htm">Robertson Progenitors</A>
<P>
A personal family history.  One interesting note: these two genealogies
share some names.  The primary link person is Sir James Stewart, known as
"The Black Knight of Lorn."  For one thing, his granddaughter, Isabelle,
married the first person to use the name Robertson (Alexander, the 5th
Baron of Struan).  For another thing, Sir James married into an ancient
lineage by marrying Joan Beaufort, the widow of the murdered King James I
of Scotland and grand-daughter of John of Gaunt Plantagenet (himself the
great-grandson of King Edward I of England).
<P>
Finally, Sir James' ancestry can be traced back on one side to the early
Dalriadic kings of what became Scotland, and on the other to the Norse
ancestors of the first persons to bear the name "Stewart" who settled
in Normandy and Brittany.
<P>
Note: If you're a researcher interested in the Robertson database as a
GEDCOM file, email me at

<H4>Published</H4>

<P>
Chambers, William Pitt -- <I>Blood and Sacrifice: The Civil War Journal of a Confederate Soldier</I>, Richard A.
Baumgartner, ed., Blue Acorn Press, 1994.  A riveting account of the war-time experiences of a man closely related
to the Mississippi Robertsons of the 1800s.  Probably the most appalling aspect is how matter-of-factly the writer
describes the many deaths of his friends--not in the shock of battle, but from sickness and injury.
<P>
Davies, John -- <I>A History of Wales</I>, Penguin, 1990.  Not only is this a very good study of Welsh history, it
contains two genealogical tables (along with some interesting supplementary tables) for making sense of the intricate
connections of the various royal bloodlines.
<P>
Fraser, Antonia, ed. -- <I>The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England</I>, University of California Press, 1975.  Along
with discussion from several historians on the various English monarchs, each dynasty (e.g., Plantagenet, Stuart, Windsor)
has an associated genealogical table.  While not complete, the tables are good for understanding the relationships among
the families through time.
<P>
Whyte, Donald -- <I>Scottish Surnames and Families</I>, Barnes and Noble, 1996.  A handy reference to many of
the best-known Scottish surnames, with details on family titles and lands.

<H4>WWW</H4>

<P><A HREF="http://www.familysearch.org/" TARGET="NEW">Mormon FamilySearch</A> is the Web site from
the Mormon Church that has (to the delight of researchers everywhere) finally gone on-line. It's
a good place to start trying to find your ancestors and relatives, but be aware that there are a
lot of people trying to use it, so it can be very slow at times. Be patient.
<P><A HREF="http://www.dcs.hull.ac.uk/public/genealogy/royal/catalog.html" TARGET="NEW">Dictionary
of Royal Genealogy Data</A> is the first place you want to go if you're interested in the genealogy
of European royal lines. (And believe me, once you match one of these folks, you've got 'em
all--you won't believe how many linkages there are among these families.)
<P><A HREF="http://ftp.cac.psu.edu/~saw/royal/royalgen.html" TARGET="NEW">Denis R. Reid's ROYALS</A>
is a very good HTML-version genealogy of the progenitors of the British royal family.
<P><A HREF="http://www.genforum.com/" TARGET="NEW">GenForum</A> is an on-line message forum that
focuses mainly on U.S. ancestors.
<P><A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/History/Genealogy/" TARGET="NEW">Yahoo
Genealogy Links</A> is a large collection of links to genealogical sites on the Web.
<P><A HREF="http://home.clara.net/wrensl/genealrs.htm" TARGET="NEW">Genealogical Research</A>
describes how to do genealogical research in England, Scotland and Wales.
