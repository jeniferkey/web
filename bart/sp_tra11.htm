AUGUST 28 (Monday)     -- Inverness to Dundee
</H3>

<P>
Monday, I tried not to fuss at anyone about anything.  Today we would be driving out of our way 
southeast to Dundee for no other reason than to allow me to see the lands in which both sides of 
my family must have lived over three hundred years ago.  So I resolved to keep any complaints I 
might have to myself; the people with whom I was traveling were doing me a significant favor.
Our first stop along the way was the Highland Folk Museum (<I>Am Fasgadh</I> in Scots Gaelic) in 
Kingussie.  Although I did not know it at the time, this was a museum originally created and 
operated by a woman named Isabel Frances Grant, who also wrote several books describing daily 
Scottish life of years past.  One of them, Highland Folk Ways, described several of the most 
interesting items I saw on display.
<P>
One of them was an entire gentleman's suit cut from the old Robertson tartan.  It elicited more 
giggles than awe, since to our eyes the bold colors of the ancient Robertson sett look garish and 
wild, but a man dressed in such a suit in his day would have commanded attention, if not respect.  
And he wouldn't have lived far away from the museum, either; the old Robertson lands of Struan 
lay but a few miles to the south.
<P>
Another of the museum's many artifacts lay outside, set in the fields of what was rapidly 
becoming a tamer version of the Highlands the further southeast we drove.  This was a <I>taigh 
dubh</I> (pronounced "tie doo"), or "black house."  On the outside it would not seem to merit such 
a name; it was a rather small, rectangular affair, with thick gray stone walls the height of a 
tall man's shoulders.  Atop these walls rested a sloping roof of golden thatch held down by ropes 
secured with stones resting on the wide ledges of the walls.  Upon entering the house, which had 
been built according to the usual plan by a man who had constructed many such homes on the far 
northwestern island of Lewis, we discovered that the interior roof and beams were pitch-black, and 
reeked of peat smoke--thus the name "black house."
<P>
The museum had provided human guides in several places, such as the barn filled with farm 
implements which still smelled of well-oiled leather and freshly-cut hay (taking me back in an 
instant to my days as a child when I visited the farms of my grandfather Robertson's older 
brothers).  The taigh dubh was no exception.  Inside, seated in the main room beside an 
incongruous electric heater, was a woman dressed in the typical garb of a Scottish wife of two 
hundred years past.  Under normal circumstances, I would have been far too aware of my 
"touristy" status to have said a word, but the opportunity for family history research was too 
good to pass up.  So I immediately began quizzing our guide on every detail about the small 
house I could think of.  I asked about the timbers supporting the roof (literally more valuable than 
gold to natives of islands where trees would not grow); I asked about the chimney (there was 
none, the smoke rose through a small hole in the center of the roof or not at all); I asked about the 
byre at one end of the home (located at the lowest point of a slope so that the effluence of the 
cattle, which were housed along with the families during the frigid winter months, would avoid 
the hard-packed dirt of the floor in the children's area, the kitchen, and the main bedroom).
When I realized that I was still asking questions even though Beth and Ann had long since moved 
on, I reluctantly thanked my guide and exited, getting a good picture of the outside of the cottage 
as I hastened back to our car.
<P>
Struan was next, and the Clan Donnachaidh Museum at Calvine where I hoped to learn more 
about my Robertson connections.  It took a bit of inspired map-reading, but we finally found it, 
dwarfed by a modern visitor's center at Bruar Falls.  (I didn't see anything falling, but Tricia 
went wandering off for a while; perhaps she found the Falls.)  I went into the Museum and 
promptly lost myself in history again.
<P>
One of the things I'd been looking forward to doing at the museum was asking about the still-
questionable linkage of the "five brothers" who patented a headright by the James River near 
Richmond, Virginia in the late 1600s.  When I posed this question to the lady I found in charge 
of the museum, her response was to ask me to send her information!  So the mystery remains, but 
the good news is that an electronic database of the members of Clan Donnachaidh (which 
actually includes the families of Robertson, Reid, Duncan and others) may soon be constructed 
and available to genealogical researchers.
<P>
After pausing to admire the red deer idling in a field across from the museum (and locating 
Tricia), our next stop was Blair Atholl.  This has been for many years the home of the Dukes of 
Atholl, owners of the extensive lands of which Struan was a modest part.  Before the Scottish 
Crown granted the lands to the Murray family, the Earls of Tullibardine, and before the Murrays 
were granted the hereditary title of Duke, these grounds were a stronghold of the Strathbogie 
family, the old Celtic Earls of Atholl.
<P>
After the Murrays came into possession of the lands of Atholl, they continued to expand and refit 
Blair Atholl.  Some repair work was necessary after the estate was damaged by Oliver 
Cromwell's troops in 1652, as well as after Lord George Murray's conquest of his own home 
before Culloden (giving it the dubious distinction of being the last castle in Britain ever to be 
besieged).  The estate was simplified during its repair, with various turrets and crenelations (and 
two stories!) removed, but these were replaced in the 19th century when architectural tastes 
changed once again to favor the romantic "baronial" style.
<P>
Today, Blair Atholl is a relatively large castle, different from others we had seen in that it affects 
an almost Tudor appearance: dark wooden beams protrude from brightly whitewashed walls, and 
large rooms connect to one another at odd angles.  This gives it the appearance of something 
constructed piecemeal as a family manor home, rather than a purely defensive structure 
converted over the centuries into a residence as are many of the other occupied castles of 
Scotland.
<P>
We spent a long time in Blair Atholl, as there was so much to see.  The grand and richly paneled 
entryway of the Picture Staircase, its walls bristling with carefully arranged pikes, axes, 
claymores, sabers and shields, was only a small taste of what was to come.  We followed other 
tourists from room to room to room, each of which was guarded by large portraits of family 
members covering every wall.  Some of the rooms, especially the dining rooms, had on display 
family treasures and heirlooms such as finely engraved silver tea services and traditional two-
handled quaichs.  Other rooms had more of a "daily living" quality, such as the bedrooms with 
their (to our modern eyes) tiny beds and well-crafted but simple furnishings.
It didn't take long before we found ourselves hurrying to get through the castle--there was just 
so much to see in so little time that we began to feel impatient.  Consequently, it's difficult to 
describe the specific things I saw at Blair Atholl; the large number of objects and the speed with 
which I moved past them made them a blur in my mind even as I was getting back in the car to 
continue the drive south.
<P>
On our way we passed the remains of Birnam Wood (as in Shakespeare's Macbeth), but I was 
unable to observe anything clearly identifiable as this forest.  The great majority of Scotland 
appeared in most places to have been cleared of trees for years.  By the time the Industrial 
Revolution was well under way, Birnam Wood and its nobler cousin, the great Caledonian 
Forest, had long since been denuded, their roots and branches made into charcoal or simply 
burned for heat.  What remains is a kind of imposing emptiness--beautiful in the same empty 
way that the desolate plains of the Moon must have seemed to those who have stood there.
After bypassing Perth, we spent some time trying to find our hotel in Dundee.  I remember some 
of the streets of this city by the Tay as being rough and cobbled, which is picturesque even if it is 
a bit bumpy.  Directions to an Italian restaurant turned into an extended hike alongside roadside 
parks framing the Tay; by the time we reached our destination we were ready to chew old leather 
for supper.  Luckily the cuisine turned out to be considerably tastier.
