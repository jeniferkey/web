<P>
  <I> it was not at all easy to quantify what it was in the writing which gave them away. </I>
<P>
  And that is the key, isn't it?  Picking what aspects of essay writing to consider, ranking
  them, and determining how to quanitfy them.
<P>
  On the basis of a little experience in AI (and possibly some in writing), I think I can make
  a reasonably good guess at how this program works.  From the article it sounds very much like
  the designers have adopted the "do what I do" approach, wherein the skills of a human essay
  analyst (more commonly known as a "teacher") are studied and broken into their elemental
  functions.  Basically just another venue for "knowledge engineering."
<P>
  I guess it works like this: First, a bunch of writing teachers are questioned.  They're asked
  what factors they grade papers on and the importance of each.  The ratings of all the factors
  are summed, and the top few factors (selected--if this is a scientific approach--by statistical
  significance) become the measurement factors.
<P>
  Then the measurement factors have to converted from subjective forms ("It made me laugh") to
  objective, numeric forms ("On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is absolute seriousness and 10 is
  metaphysically perfect humor, this rates a 7").  Specifically, the process by which a numeric
  rating is generated has to be worked out, based on the factor being analyzed.
<P>
  Next, the interface between input (words and phrases and "flow" of an essay) and measurement
  factors must be determined.  This means mapping the parts of actual essays to numeric scores
  in each of the factors.  As a simple example, how much do you take off for spelling someone's
  name wrong in an essay?  A more complex example might consider scoring for use of active voice
  versus passive voice, or for average reading level.  (It should be noted that these last two
  forms of numeric quantification of writing already exist.)
<P>
  The subject matter for any given essay then must be analyzed and codified numerically to
  provide a basis for comparing the input (the student's essay) to the expected result (a
  hypothetically "perfect" essay).  This information comes in two varieties: one, an invariant
  type dealing with certain rules that don't change--things like spelling and punctuation--and
  two, specialized information dealing strictly with the assigned subject's content, which
  changes from assignment to assignment.  The invariant rules can be "hard-coded"; the variable
  content-based expectations have to be input to the program for each assignment.
<P>
  Finally, human teachers rate sample essays.  This is a learning function that fine-tunes the
  program.  The program can allow for some flexibility here by letting the teachers who run
  the program give different weightings to the rules.  For example, one teacher might count
  off heavily for spelling mistakes but prefer to give lots of leeway on style, while another
  might prefer to ignore spelling errors to give more weight to content.
<P>
  Of course I don't know exactly what the real program's authors have done or how they've done
  it.  But this is how I'd start to go about it.
<P>
  <I> Think of two extremes in literature -- James Joyce's massive, unpunctuated, stream of
  consciousness in the latter part of Ulysses, and Hemingway's enormous efforts to avoid the
  use of compound sentences. Both wrote incredibly well </I>
<P>
  True, but let's be fair: the computer program described isn't meant to analyze literature--just
  essay papers.  Art may exist for art's sake, but an essay has a specific function to achieve:
  Mention the vital facts about some subject.  It may or may not be required to do more than
  that--to be literary, in other words--but at a minimum it must state the required facts.
<P>
  The question is, is doing the minimum good enough?
<P>
  The tricky part is that the higher up the ladder of abstraction you go. the harder it is for
  a program to "understand."  In other words, analysis down at the elemental level of words and
  punctuation is relatively easy--you're just asking an "exists/doesn't exist" question.  Even
  questions of content aren't too difficult--the rules are more variable, but content is still
  mostly an "exists/doesn't exist" question.
<P>
  But what about "meaning?"  Can any program really answer the Big Question: Did the student
  say something interesting about the subject?  That's a very high level of abstraction.  Current
  computer programs just don't do it very well, and in fact may actually require sentience to do
  it at all.  After all, a program may know what a "ball" is, and may be able to tell you all the
  definitions of a "base"--but is it likely to experience the flood of concepts many Americans
  would at encountering the word "baseball?"
<P>
  Consider: Suppose you're assigned an essay on Winston Churchill's rallying of England during
  the Blitz.  At one point in your essay, you mention that Churchill owned a pet bulldog.  What
  should a computer program do with that?  Mark down your paper for irrelevancy?  Or give you
  extra credit for making a metaphorical link between Churchill's personality and England's
  bulldog-like tenacity in the face of ruin?
<P>
  This "meaning" level is very, very tough for current computer programs to work with
  successfully.  Therefore, if understanding the meaning of an essay--including all the
  allusions and metaphors and "telling details"--is a necessary function, then a computer
  program probably won't do well.  Montaigne himself would probably score poorly.
<P>
  OTOH, if you're simply looking for "just the facts, ma'am," and the grammatical correctness
  of their presentation, then a computer program might do just fine.  It's only if you insist
  that an essay must be "art" that a program might fail to impress.
<P>
  It does raise some interesting questions, though, doesn't it?
</P>

<HR>

<P>
  After having given this subject a bit more thought, I now have a guess as to why this
  essay-grading program meets with such resistance (even if only of the "it can't work"
  variety).
<P>
  If it can't work, then there's no problem, so let's assume it can work.  This isn't the
  same as saying that any particular program <EM>does</EM> work, just that it is within the
  realm of possibility for some program at some time to examine and grade essay papers to a
  useful level of accuracy (however that's defined).
<P>
  Where's the problem, then?  Is it that a computer is doing something previously done by
  humans?  Well, no.  For example, humans can add up numbers just fine, but we now tend to
  prefer to let computers do it.  For that matter, the abacus has been around for quite
  some time.  It also used to be the case that "art" could only be produced with physical
  materials: clay, paint, pianos.  Now we use computers not only to assist in applications
  of those media, but even as entirely new media (consider the Pixar/Disney movie
  <I>Toy Story</I>).  Computers aren't just helping humans do old things better--they're
  actually allowing us to do things we could never do before.
<P>
  In fact, the whole point of computer programs is that they enhance human intellectual
  capabilities, much as machines--whether as complicated as a car or as simple as a
  lever--enhance human physical capabilities.  We could do accounting by filling rooms
  full of people with pencils and paper... but we don't, because letting a machine--a
  computer program--do the grunt work frees up human beings to do something else.
<P>
  So it can't be that we're averse to an essay grading program just because it "does a
  human's job."  There must be some other reason.
<P>
  My guess?  It's this: unlike other programs (or machines), an essay grading program
  tries to perform a human function to whose application we humans are extremely
  sensitive--the critical function of <EM>judging</EM>.
<P>
  If I grade your paper and tell you I marked off because of 1, 2, and 3, there is of
  necessity an element of subjectivity in my grade.  You can argue with me about it.  You
  might even persuade me to change my mind.
<P>
  But how do you argue with a machine?
<P>
  My point is that we tend to be very concerned with judgements made about us.  It's bad
  enough when another human being presumes to judge us.  What they are actually telling
  us is that, in some area, to some degree, we fail to measure up to their expectations
  of us.  That can be a hard pill to swallow, and so we constantly erect barriers against
  being judged.  In some cases (such as school) we allow it... but we never like it.
<P>
  How much worse, then, when we are judged by a collection of transistors and voltage
  levels!  How dare a mere machine presume to criticize <EM>me</EM>!  All my tricks for
  emotionally manipulating human teachers into increasing my grade are useless if I'm
  being graded by a machine.  Why, I might even have to actually WORK to meet an objective
  standard of performance.
<P>
  As you can see from my little segue here *grin*, I think there's another side to this
  question.  For a lot of people, yes, accepting a computer program which exercises a
  judging function is very hard.  All the "people" skills--the measure by which many
  persons judge themselves--become worthless.  Ergo, they feel worthless.  (At least
  in one limited though perhaps important area.)
<P>
  But not everyone is like that.  Some folks would rather deal with the world in
  objective terms.  It drives this kind of person nuts that some slacker who washes
  the teacher's car or who shows a little cleavage can get away with failing to meet
  specific standards of work.  For that matter, what if the teacher (or the boss) is
  having a bad day?  The subjectivity of the person doing the judging can make it seem
  pointless to work hard to achieve a specified objective goal.
<P>
  For these persons, a computerized essay grader might seem like heaven.  Instead of
  having to try to use social skills that have nothing whatsoever to do with the
  essay's assigned content, they can concentrate wholly on the assignment.  And when
  they're done, they know that everyone's work will be held to the same standard.
<P>
  So I think it comes down to a personal preference.  By whom would you rather be
  judged: someone who can understand you, and whom you might be able to influence in
  your favor, or something with objectivity that can be trusted, and for which a
  standard really is a standard and not a moving target?
<P>
  One thing I do know is that we'd better get used to answering such
  questions.  Programs are only going to get "smarter."
<P>
  ...
<P>
  A subsidiary note:
<P>
  <I> Invariant? Spelling and punctuation? I don't think so *grin*. A rigid approach to
  spelling might work at the high school level, but in post secondary essays I doubt
  it. </I>
<P>
  From my perspective, "rigidity," in spelling or punctuation or grammar, isn't as
  impossible as you make it sound.  An essay checker could easily be programmed to
  accept national or even regional variants; a program would probably give you far
  less trouble about words like "colour" or "optimise" or "programme" than the typical
  U.S. teacher.
<P>
  Furthermore, the rules for punctuation and grammar are no mystery.  Strunk and
  White's <I>The Elements of Style</I> offers a short but reasonably complete guide;
  for professional writers (such as reporters and essayists) there is the <I>Chicago
  Manual of Style</I> in its distinctive red jacket.  Where these and others differ,
  options can be provided to the program.  And, finally, I note that the <EM>basics</EM>
  are well-understood and agreed upon.
<P>
  This is something of a quibble with respect to an essay grading program, which
  presumably would be a lot more concerned with content than with form.  (That is,
  it would tend to deduct fewer points for a punctuation error than for omission of
  a key concept.)  I mention it only because I think it's worthwhile for us humans
  in general to know that there are very readable guides to good grammar out there,
  and that they really don't disagree with one another much at all.
</P>
