<H3>The &quot;Ecological&quot; Prisoner's Dilemma</H3>

<P>After deriving some preliminary conclusions about this result,
Axelrod tried an even more interesting innovation. In this new
round, for which Axelrod publicly requested submissions from any
source, there were 62 entrants plus one (RANDOM, from Axelrod)
for a total of 63. All these strategies were then pitted against
one another in a giant free-for-all tournament.
<P>
The winner was Tit for Tat, submitted again by Rapaport. (But,
oddly, by no one else.) Again, it had the highest average score
of payoffs.
<P>
Axelrod scored the results of the tournament as a 63x63 matrix
which showed how each strategy had fared against every other
strategy. An analysis of the strategies played revealed that
there were six strategies that best represented all the others.
Since the 63x63 matrix showed how each strategy played against
all others, Axelrod was able to calculate the results of six
hypothetical &quot;replays&quot; in which one of the six
representative strategies was initially dominant.
<P>
Tit for Tat scored first in five of the six replays, and
scored second in the sixth.
<P>
Then came the cleverest innovation yet. Suppose, Axelrod's
notion had it, we performed a hypothetical replay in which all
strategies were pitted against each other, and in each turn the
&quot;loser&quot; was replaced by a copy of the
&quot;winning&quot; strategy, thus altering the population of
players? Each strategy's score--already known from the 63x63
matrix--could treated as a measure of &quot;fitness&quot; against
other strategies in a kind of &quot;ecological&quot; tournament.
<P>
The results left no doubt. The lowest-ranked strategies, which
tended to be &quot;not-nice&quot; (in other words, which tried to
defect occasionally to see what they could get away with), were
extinct within 200 rounds. Only one not-nice strategy (which had
been ranked eighth in the original 63x63 competition) lasted past
400 rounds, but by then the population of surviving strategies
consisted only of those which replied to defections with
immediate retaliation. Because the not-nice strategy had no more
strategies which could be taken advantage of, it began a
precipitous decline. By the thousandth round, it too was
virtually eliminated.
<P>
And the winning strategy? Once again it was Tit for Tat, which
was not only the most prevalent strategy at the end of 1000
rounds, but the strategy with the highest rate of growth. Tit for
Tat was not merely successful, it was <em>robust</em>--it did
well in all kinds of environments.
<P>
Why did Tit for Tat do so well? How could such a simple
strategy perform so capably in such a broad mix of more complex
strategies? More to the essential point, how could Tit for Tat do
so well even when surrounded by strategies which depended on
defecting and so would supposedly tend to earn better payoffs? It
appeared that a strategy which cooperated by default was able to
not only survive but actually thrive amidst a sea of defectors.
<P>
In other words, cooperation evolved over time in a world
dominated by uncooperative players. If this simulation bore any
relation to the real world of humans, there could be some
important lessons in it for us.
