<TR><TD colspan=2>
  The Relevance Criterion is the expectation that the parts of an argument
  have a material impact on the discussion.  Irrelevant assertions (sometimes
  called <I>non sequiturs</I>) are those which do not provide necessary evidence
  and have no bearing on the truth or falsehood of an conclusion.  Thus they
  cannot lead to a defensible conclusion.
