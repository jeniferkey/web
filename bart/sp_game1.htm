      Wolf-3D was unique in two particular ways: it was the closest
      thing to a three-dimensional "you are there" game when it was
      introduced, and it had a "mission"-based design which allowed the
      first of three complete missions to be distributed as shareware
      (which insured lots of gamers would try it).  The latter proved to
      be a huge business success, but that wouldn't have happened if the
      game itself hadn't been something new.  The programmers at id
      managed to devise a highly-optimized version of raytracing known
      as "raycasting"; with the addition of equally speedy texture
      mapping and opponent sprites which could be viewed from multiple
      angles (further creating the illusion of 3-D), Wolf-3D was an
      important step in popularizing 3-D 1st-person games.  Although no
      one knew it at the time, it would also become the first major
      force in the eventual development of consumer-priced 3-D graphics
      hardware accelerators.

      What's behind that door?  That was the eternal question of this
      game.  You always found yourself wondering what strange new walls
      or maze layout or guards would be behind any door; there was a
      constant pressure to keep moving, to keep opening the next
      door.  What nasty traps have the level designers set for the
      unwary player?  Open the door and find out.

      Once you'd finished a level (including its secrets), there was no
      reason or incentive to go back.  Likewise, once you'd killed off a
      mission's "boss" there wasn't anything else to do or to see.  On
      the other hand, once the information on how to construct levels
      found its way to the public, new levels began to appear on
      bulletin board systems and on-line services, leading to something
      of a renaissance in playing this game.

      Although you could find yourself wishing for more kinds of bad
      guys and more variety in the landscape, Wolf-3D was enormously
      fun.  There was just something very satisfying about mowing down
      bad guys without having to worry about ethical consequences; it
      was simple "kill-or-be-killed."  id's concept of a pure action
      game was gleefully accepted by thousands of gamers.  Not only
      was it popular because it generally didn't require you to think,
      focusing like a laser on action made the game a lot easier to
      write.  There were no secondary weapon effects (like ricocheting
      shots or damage to doors or walls); nothing about the environment
      ever changed; and the bad guys would always come straight at you
      if they "heard" or "saw" you.  Wolf-3D was a pure shoot-em-up.  It
      focused exclusively on what most action gamers wanted, and its
      developers reaped the rewards of understanding the market.

      By the time System Shock was released, Looking Glass (in its
      earlier incarnation as "Blue Sky") had already released the
      ground-breaking "true" 3-D games, Ultima Underworld I and II, and
      id had released the extremely successful Doom.  But while the
      software technology might no longer have been amazing (despite the
      realistic physics model used), Looking Glass nevertheless did
      manage to create a playing environment that was more detailed,
      more graphically diverse, and which offered more ways to interact
      with the numerous game objects than any game before and very few
      since.  One feature worthy of special note: Each game allowed the
      player to configure System Shock's four aspects: number and
      strength of enemies, difficulty of puzzles, difficulty of the
      "cyberspace" environment, and depth of plot.  All these aspects
      had four levels of control, ranging from easy to hard.  Thus, a
      devotee of the "Doom" school (more action than thinking) could opt
      for a game with lots of strong enemies but minimal puzzles and
      plot, while someone more comfortable with graphical adventures
      could choose to play a game with a few weak enemies but difficult
      puzzles and a rich plot.  To my knowledge, this level of game
      customization remains unique.

      Visually, System Shock featured strong colors, which set it apart
      from the drab Doom.  Also unlike Doom, the environment of System
      Shock was more consistent from level to level, so that the player
      felt part of a larger "universe."  These elements, along with the
      expressive audio cues and sound effects, generated a very high
      level of addictiveness.  There was a constant interest in seeing
      what lay around the next corner--perhaps strange new vistas, or
      more dangerous new enemies... or a more powerful new weapon.  The
      most addictive element, however, may have been the plot.  Dropped
      throughout each level were data disks which contained the message
      logs of the doomed workers aboard the Trioptimum space
      station.  Further enhancing the plot were email messages sent to
      the player in "real time" by various off-stage actors, including
      the insane station computer, SHODAN.  Each action completed by the
      player led to a new revelation about SHODAN and its creator, as
      well as new goals for the player to pursue.  Following the threads
      of this plot made System Shock almost a graphical adventure in
      itself, combining the best of that genre with the best in 3-D
      1st-person shooters.

      The difficulty of the game (particularly in the "cyberspace" end
      sequence) and the sheer depth of exploration required both tend to
      minimize replayability.  It's just too much, especially when there
      are so many other games hitting store shelves.  Furthermore, once
      the game is won, it does not change in any significant way from
      previous runs.  Enemy locations and possessions are randomized,
      as is one important code sequence, but individual puzzles, maps,
      and the "email"-based game plot elements remain constant.  And
      yet... the environment is so immersive, so rich and interesting,
      that replaying this game is like revisiting a favorite place.  You
      just want to go hang out for a while.

      The one word heard most often in reference to System Shock is
      "immersive."  Not every gamer enjoys depth of interaction in a
      game--the designers at id, for example, deliberately kept their
      games simple to concentrate on maximum action.  For other gamers,
      who prefer to exercise their minds as well as their reflexes,
      System Shock is often named as the single most memorable gaming
      experience they have ever had.  Artwork and audio, enemies and
      puzzles, level design and plot line; all these things came
      together seamlessly in System Shock.  The designers at Looking
      Glass have said that one of their goals with their earlier
      1st-person "Underworld" games was to offer many different ways
      for the player to interact with game objects.  In this way,
      different players could respond to game challenges in different
      ways--even in ways that the designers themselves didn't
      anticipate.  System Shock carried on this tradition, and in so
      doing led the player to accept the "reality" of the System Shock
      world to a degree that few other games have ever equaled.
      <P>
      And now from E3 comes word that the good people at Looking
      Glass/Eidos have announced plans to develop System Shock II!  As
      more information on this becomes available, I'll try to post it
      here.  For now, though, this looks like the Next Great Thing to
      look forward to once Looking Glass completes <I>Thief: The Dark
      Project</I>, their current game.
      <P>
      New System Shock II info (1998/08/08): Most of the design work on
      System Shock II is being done by a new company,
      <A HREF="http://www.irrational-games.com/">Irrational Games</A>,
      which was founded by several Looking Glass alumni.  For updates on
      this and other Looking Glass projects, you definitely want to

      Neither Dark Forces nor its sequel, Jedi Knight, did much to push
      the envelope of 3-D 1st-person action games.  There was no
      revolutionary technology.  But what Lucasarts did with these games
      was to take proven technologies, clean them off, and put them
      together in a game in a way that, while it might not have been
      revolutionary, represented the pinnacle of evolution at the time
      of its introduction.  While the graphics of Dark Forces weren't at
      any incredibly high resolution, they were used well.  Sound
      effects weren't of particularly high quality (including the
      synthesized "Star Wars" theme during the game's introductory
      sequence), but they too were used appropriately to add to the "you
      are there" feel.  Jedi Knight improved on these things to meet
      current expectations, but again, not in any extreme way.  All in
      all, Jedi Knight doesn't do anything revolutionary.  But it does
      do all the things a modern 3-D 1st-person action game is expected
      these days to do, and does all of them extremely well.  Thus it
      acquires the quality of strong immersiveness that separates the
      truly great 3-D 1st-person action games from the merely good.

       Especially for those of us who were around for the original
       premiere of <I>Star Wars</I>, Dark Forces and Jedi Knight give
       us a wonderful opportunity to play around in that universe.  They
       look like the movies; they sound like the movies; the puzzles are
       diabolically clever--it's all too easy to find yourself still
       blasting away at stormtroopers well past midnight.

    <TD>
       Three levels of difficulty allow for some replayability, assuming
       the player went through the levels in Easy or Medium mode.  Other
       than that, playing through the strong plot elements and solving
       the very difficult puzzles mean that, once played, very little
       will change in subsequent games.

      Both the original Dark Forces and its sequel, Jedi Knight, were
      highly playable.  They looked good, they sounded good, and they
      played well.  Unlike some sequels, Jedi Knight took the things
      that Dark Forces did well and improved on them, while adding new
      features to make the game even more fun.  For example, Dark Forces
      offered very large vistas, giving a much greater feeling of
      openness than that of Doom.  It also required the player to solve
      puzzles that were more difficult than Doom's.  Finally, Dark
      Forces gave the player the chance to play in the Star Wars
      universe; sounds, artwork, weapons and enemies all contributed to
      giving Dark Forces a more distinctive feel than other 3-D games
      which were essentially Doom with different texture maps.
      <P>
      Jedi Knight did all these things even better.  Levels became still more
      wide-open, to the point that this player found himself hugging the
      walls in some places, nervous about moving.  The number of video
      resolutions at which the game could be run were increased, so that
      the game looked much sharper.  The puzzles became more fiendish,
      especially one in which the player has only a minute or three to
      escape from a spaceship which is falling to the ground.  As the
      bulkheads groan and klaxons blare in the player's ear, and the
      deck heaves and pitches at crazy angles, the player is forced to
      scramble frantically from one part of the doomed ship to another
      in search of a way out.  It is incredibly frustrating... but
      incredibly immersive.  (And incredibly satisfying when finally
      completed!)
      <P>
      Best of all, the player is pulled even further into
      the Star Wars universe by the introduction of "the Force."  These
      are various abilities, such as jumping like Luke out of the
      carbon-freeze pit in <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> or (if one
      gives in to the Dark Side) to damage enemies with the "Force grip"
      (which Darth Vader used in the original <I>Star Wars</I> on the
      Admiral whose lack of faith was so disturbing).  Another very nice
      touch in Jedi Knight is the addition of the lightsaber as a
      weapon.  Not only does this add yet again to the "Star Wars" feel,
      it's a clever way to adapt an old gaming technology ("hand-to-hand
      combat") to a new purpose with a meaningful function.  An
      available "companion mission" (in other words, a set of additional
      levels) even includes a deathmatch level which mimics the interior
      of Cloud City in <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> where Luke and
      Vader fight--if you break open the large circular window, you get
      sucked out and must try to land on the narrow ledge below.  You
      can even damage the railing with your lightsaber just like Vader
      did after Luke injures Vader in his shoulder.
      <P>
      With their X-Wing
      and Tie Fighter space combat games, Lucasarts earned a good
      reputation with both gamers and game industry observers for games
      that leverage the "Star Wars" franchise and are still incredibly
      fun to play.  Dark Forces and Jedi Knight demonstrate that this
      reputation continues to be deserved (despite the poor showing of
      <I>Star Wars: Rebellion</I> due to its complicated user interface).
