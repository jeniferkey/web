<H3><I>The Vision of the Anointed</I></H3>

<BR>
<H4>Introduction</H4>

<BR>
<P>
One of the soundest thinkers and clearest writers on the subject of
modern political expression is Dr. Thomas Sowell.  In his book, <I>The
Vision of the Anointed</I> (1995, HarperCollins), he presents a
powerful model for understanding the process by which today's liberals
achieve their public policy goals.  (The views which follow are based on
my own understanding of Dr. Sowell's book; in no way should he be held
responsible for any of my opinions expressed below.)
<P>
This book is subtitled "Self-Congratulation as a Basis for Social
Policy".  The author backs up that assertion with pertinent facts,
ruthless logic, appropriate examples, and a sense of humor that is
restrained out of deference to the human damage done by the liberal
model of public policy debate.  This is, in fact, the larger point of
the book, a point generally missed by reviewers (particularly the
poisonous Kirkus species).  It's not about attacking any particular
"bad" liberal policy; Dr. Sowell stalks much larger game here.  Namely,
he is out to expose the fundamental basis by which movement liberals
choose all their policies, and the common method by which they attempt
to implement those policies.
<P>
For Dr. Sowell, both expressions grow from the essential liberal
motivation: "I'm better than you because I care more than you do."  In
other words, both what they do and how they do it are driven by a desire
to enhance their self-esteem <EM>at someone else's expense</EM>.  It is
not enough to be simply a good person; the ideological liberal must
believe that he is <EM>better</EM> than you in order to feel good about
himself.  All else follows from this quest to prove moral superiority.
<P>
In particular, what follows is a crusade to change some aspect of human
nature by changing human society from the top down.  When the crusade
fails--often spectacularly, human nature being irrationally resistant to
nagging--the continuation of demonstrably unnecessary and even
counterproductive social policies is defended in hyperemotional attacks
on critics.  The admission of error is evaded at any cost, because it
would mean forfeiting the belief of moral superiority.
<P>
Within the first few pages of <I>The Vision of the Anointed</I> Dr.
Sowell lists the elements that are common to the liberal crusades of
this century, and the pattern in which these policy demands are imposed
and maintained.  The rest of the book explains why this pattern is the
predictable outcome of having a vision of oneself as anointed to save
the world--whether it needs saving or not.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>The Elements of the Crusade</H4>

<BR>
<P>
Despite the variety of liberal crusades in the latter part of this
century--examples include the welfare state, socialism, communism,
Keynesian economics, environmentalism (particularly Malthusianism and
"global warming"), and medical, automotive, and nuclear safety--these
crusades share certain similar elements.
</P>

<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>The Warning of Danger</B>
<P>
A great danger to the whole society is asserted, a danger to which the
masses are oblivious (but to which the anointed are uniquely sensitive).
</P>
<LI><B>The Call to Action</B>
<P>
Urgent action is demanded to avert the impending catastrophe.  Again,
while malevolent forces try to preserve the <I>status quo</I>, the
anointed--wiser and more caring than others--are fighting to rescue you.
</P>
<LI><B>The Invocation of Authority</B>
<P>
The government is called upon to set stringent limits on the dangerous
behavior of the many, in recognition of the prescient conclusions of the
few.  Since most people aren't as enlightened as the anointed, it stands
to reason that they are part of the problem.  They are thus likely to
resist the proposed change, so--for their own good, of course--they must
be forced via the threat or actual application of state power to comply
with the new required behavior.
</P>
<LI><B>The Demonization of Critics</B>
<P>
Arguments which criticize any aspect of the crusade are dismissed as
uninformed, irresponsible, or motivated by unworthy purposes.  Since the
self-esteem of the anointed rests on being perceived as a savior, anyone
who threatens to reveal the truth--that the solution was worse than the
supposed problem--is by definition evil.  Destroying such critics is a
commendable act of "courage."
</P>
</UL>

<BR>
<H4>The Pattern of Failure</H4>

<BR>
<P>
As all humans are imperfect, any human vision must be flawed as well.  A
key feature of any vision is the degree to which it recognizes its
inherent imperfection and adapts itself to reality as new information is
revealed.
<P>
One of the most fascinating aspects of the vision of the anointed is its
astonishing resistance to accepting reality.  So strong is the impulse
toward moral superiority that evidence which contradicts claims made by
the anointed is often ignored, dismissed, ridiculed, or shouted down.  A
recent example is the release of statistics concerning minority entrance
applications to the University of California system of colleges.  The
UC system released only the information for the two campuses whose
minority applications dropped the most.  By the time the much higher
numbers for the other campuses were released two days later, the <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> and the <I>New York Times</I> had printed front-page,
headline stories (picked up by other news agencies) claiming that ending
the UC system's special racial preferences had in fact led to more
"discrimination."  The facts which contradicted this conclusion were
buried... if they were published at all.  Evidence that threatened the
position of the anointed--that not giving blacks and members of certain
other groups special preference in college admissions (even at the
expense of better-qualified members of other groups) would cause massive
discriminatory harm--was ignored.  As with other crusades whose primary
purpose is proving moral superiority, if reality conflicts with the
desired perception, then reality must be suppressed.
<P>
Dr. Sowell examines this effect by considering the typical pattern in
which the visions of the anointed are imposed and fail.
</P>

<BR>
<OL>
<LI><B>The "Crisis"</B>
<P>
Some situation is said to be so bad as to constitute a "crisis," even
though only a few persons see it clearly enough to sound a warning.  The
evidence offered to support this claim is usually an exaggeration of the
negatives that can be found in any human situation, or a misuse or
misinterpretation of minimal or even unrelated statistics.
</P>
<LI><B>The "Solution"</B>
<P>
The anointed offer a "solution"  which they claim will lead to desirable
result A.  Critics dissent, offering evidence and logic to support the
counterclaim that the proposed policy will actually lead to undesirable
result Z.  The anointed respond with scorn and ridicule, and imply dark
motives on the part of their critics.
</P>
<LI><B>The Results</B>
<P>
The policy is implemented and leads to undesirable result Z warned of
by its critics.
</P>
<LI><B>The Response</B>
<P>
Excuses, rationalizations and evasions ensue.  Either some other factor
or combination of factors caused undesirable result Z, or the solution
wasn't given enough resources (time, money) to work, or the critics
arrayed against the solution lied/conspired/outspent their moral
betters, or things would actually have been far worse without the
implemented solution, or undesirable result Z is actually a
<EM>good</EM> thing, or some other form of handwaving is employed.
</P>
</OL>

<P>
The point is always that the crisis was real and the solution wasn't
wrong... and the anointed should be given credit for their courage in
recognizing and publicizing the problem, and for their good intentions
in trying to solve it--no matter how awful the result.  They are never
called to account for their failed original claim--that implementing
their policy would lead to desirable result A--which is conveniently
forgotten.  Instead, the anointed place the burden of proof on their
critics to show a linkage between the imposed policy and the undesirable
result.  This leaves the critics playing "what-if" games, which are
rarely persuasive, even when news agencies bother to report them.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>

<BR>
<P>
The main complaint against <I>The Vision of the Anointed</I> is that the
repetition of the word "anointed" begins to grate after a while.  (Just
think how tired you are of seeing it in this short essay.)  But this is
a quibble.  The important aspect of this work--its assertions that there
is a reality-denying pattern to the policy activity of modern liberals,
and that this pattern is the result of the desire of these persons to
feel morally superior to other persons--is defended with clarity and
precision.
<P>
A working model of a thing does more than just explain the current
nature of that thing.  It has a predictive power.  Manipulate the model
according to some understood input; if the model is a good one, its
final configuration will accurately render what would happen in the
real world.  Dr. Sowell's model of liberal policy as the vision of the
anointed is a good one, because it allows the person who understands it
to accurately predict the liberal response to particular situations.
<P>
No model is ever anything more than an imperfect imitation of some real
thing.  For that reason, there are some situations to which it is not
appropriate to apply a given model.  This is true of Dr. Sowell's model
as well.  Not every liberal acts out of the anointed's desire to prove
moral superiority; the power of Dr. Sowell's model to explain and
predict their actions is limited.  Only if one can demonstrate that the
very impulse of liberalism itself--the urge toward improvement--is based
on an desire to prove moral superiority can one condemn liberalism in
totality.
<P>
I consider that unlikely.  Nevertheless, for those liberals--and there
seem to be an unfortunately large number of them--who are in fact
motivated by the deep-seated desire to prove just how much wiser and
more benevolent they are than the rest of us... Dr. Sowell's model
explains a lot.

<P>
Sowell, Thomas -- <I>Marxism: Philosophy and Economics</I>, Quill, 1985.  As with all of Sowell's writing, this
book is highly readable without sacrificing intellectual rigor.  Marx's economic thought is critically examined,
followed by excellent (though too short) studies of Marx's political philosophy and Marx, the man.
<P>
Sowell, Thomas -- <I>The Vision of the Anointed</I>, Basic Books, 1995.  This is one of the best books ever written
on what makes most modern political liberals tick.  Written in Sowell's characteristically clear and direct style,
a fair-minded reader will be left in no doubt as to the perils of an idealogy based on impatience, personal
gratification, and the dismissal of reality.  (Another reason to check it out: the Kirkus Reviews people frothed
venomously about it.  Any political work that induces hysterical sputtering in the Kirkus crowd must be worth reading.)
