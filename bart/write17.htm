  The question of whether or not there is and has been a discernable political tilt among the news media
  would seem to have been settled a couple of years ago in a poll which revealed that fewer than ten percent
  of Washington editors would identify themselves as "conservative."  On top of what people can read and hear
  for themselves broadcast as "news" from the news elite, it would seem obvious that most of the press tend
  to word their stories in ways sympathetic to the public liberals.  At least one self-described liberal
  bureau chief (Evan Thomas of <I>Newsweek</I>) agreed that this leftward preference is obvious.
<P>
  But I can appreciate that it might be difficult to admit this.  Part of the modern liberal mindset is the
  need to feel virtuous; the wish to believe oneself struggling against mighty forces of oppression and
  intolerance.  Trouble is, it's hard to feel like a hero if it's admitted that the press--supposedly
  objective judges--are in fact tipping the scales in one's favor.
<P>
  So to help those who are having trouble accepting reality, I've located a short collection of quotations
  taken directly from well-known reporters, journalists, and anchors over just the past ten years.  Taken
  individually, each might be no more than a dumb remark... but taken together, the pattern of liberal
  advocacy becomes harder to dismiss with an airy wave and a glib one-liner.
<P>
  The person who cares more for seeing the world as it is than for playing spin-doctor will, in my
  opinion, have no choice but to agree: Most media opinion-makers are biased to the Left.
<P>
  See for yourself.

  "After eight years of what many saw as the Reagan Administration's benign neglect of the poor and
  studied indifference to civil rights, a lot of those who lived through this week in Overtown [rioting
  in a section of Miami] seemed to think the best thing about George Bush is that he is not Ronald
  Reagan...There is an Overtown in every big city in America. Pockets of misery made even meaner and
  more desperate the past eight years."<BR>

  "Gorbachev has probably moved more quickly than any person in the history of the world. Moving faster
  than Jesus Christ did. America is always lagging six months behind...I think we can get by easily with
  a $75 billion military budget. Those bombers and all of this stuff is an absolute waste of money and a joke."<BR>

  "Few tears will be shed over the demise of the East German army, but what about East Germany's eighty
  symphony orchestras, bound to lose some subsidies, or the whole East German system, which covered
  everyone in a security blanket from day care to health care, from housing to education? Some people
  are beginning to express, if ever so slightly, nostalgia for that Berlin Wall."<BR>
  -- CBS reporter Bob Simon on the March 16 Evening News.

  "The bottom line is more tax money is going to be needed. Just how much will be the primary issue on
  the agenda when congressional leaders meet with the President later today, Wednesday, May the 9th,
  1990. And good morning, welcome to Today. It's a Wednesday morning, a day when the budget picture,

  "And then there was Anita Hill, the poised daughter of so many generations of black women who have been
  burned carrying torches into the battle for principle. The cause of civil rights and social justice has
  so often fallen to them to defend. Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth were slaves by birth, freedom
  fighters by temperament. Rosa Parks was a tired seamstress who shoved history forward by refusing to
  give up her seat on the bus...The latest to claim her place in line is Anita Hill, a private, professional
  woman unwilling to relinquish her dignity without a fight."<BR>

  "Greenpeace, the public interest organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and military,

  "The whole week was double-ply, wall-to-wall ugly...the Republican Party reached an unimaginable slouchy,

  "Roger [Clinton]'s life is in some ways the story of any younger sibling clobbered by the spectacular
  success of the one who came before. The presidential brother syndrome. If your brother is Christ, you
  have a choice: become a disciple, or become an anti-christ, or find yourself caught somewhere between the two."<BR>

  "She's [Hillary Clinton] ecumenical but prefers Italian and Mexican. The President fixes her eggs with
  jalapeno peppers on the weekends. One Christmas she served black beans and chili as part of a buffet. She
  carries Tabasco sauce wherever she goes...Valentine's Day at the Red Sage restaurant. Even at a romantic
  outing, the President can be the date from hell, talking to everyone but the girl he brung...Finally
  alone, they have 'painted soup' and the lamb baked in herbed bread. They exchange gifts and touch each
  other more in two hours than the Bushes did in four years."<BR>

  "If I'm a young black man in South Central L.A., where poverty is rampant and unemployment is
  skyrocketing, I see that Washington's promises of a year ago have gone unfulfilled, I see that
  perhaps for a second time, the court's inability to mete out justice in a blind fashion, why

  presidency of the International Green Cross, a new environmental organization..."<BR>
  -- <I>Time</I>'s "The Week" section, May 3.

  "Clinton is giving the best evidence yet of his approach to leadership. It's about understanding,
  not threats; accommodation, not confrontation; about getting people (or at least Democrats) to
  sing the same song. The style is reminiscent of another patient, nonjudgmental figure given to
  hugging in public: Barney the Dinosaur."<BR>

  "Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two- year-old and they can tell you about
  those temper tantrums: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming. It's clear that the
  anger controls the child and not the other way around. It's the job of the parent to teach the
  child to control the anger and channel it in a positive way. Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled
  two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week...Parenting and governing don't have
  to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old."<BR>
  -- ABC anchor Peter Jennings in his daily ABC Radio commentary, November 14.
<P>
  "To watch this President connect with people emotionally is an awesome thing. It's a raw, needy,
  palpable, electrifying thing that happens. There was no smile. It's as if he's soaking up the
  people like he's soaking up the sun, with the warmth pouring deep and direct into his political
  soul and recharging him, refilling him somehow once again with his own humanity and some sense
  of his role in the destiny of his country. Then, the hunger slaked, the great beast of Need fed
  once again, it seemed you could almost see the gratitude pouring off his brow like sweat as he made his way."<BR>

  "I was a correspondent in the White House in those days, and my work--which consisted of reporting on
  President Reagan's success in making life harder for citizens who were not born rich, white, and
  healthy--saddened me. My parents raised me to admire generosity and to feel pity. I had arrived in our
  nation's capital [in 1981] during a historic ascendancy of greed and hard-heartedness....Reagan couldn't
  tie his shoes if his life depended on it."<BR>

  <I>Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis</I>.

  "Yes, the case is being fomented by right-wing nuts, and yes, she is not a very credible witness, and

<P>
  "The noises coming from (Rep. Sonny) Bono and many of his fellow Republican signers of House
  Speaker Newt Gingrich's 'Contract with America' signal a radical shift in Congress's attitude
  toward environmental issues--a shift that may bode ill for the health of snail darters, spotted
  owls, and even the human species."<BR>

<I>Former IRS commissioner Donald Alexander</I>: "That's right. The sky would be blue all the time."<BR>

  "He (Ted Kaczynski) wasn't a hypocrite. He lived as he wrote. His manifesto, and there are a lot
  of things in it that I would agree with and a lot of other people would, that industrialization
  and pollution all are terrible things, but he carried it to an extreme, and obviously murder is
  something that is far beyond any political philosophy, but he had a bike. He didn't have any
