<H3>ISFP -- The Artist</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  "Private emotion in action"--that might be the best way to sum up the
motivation of the ISFP.  ISFPs live in the here and now, and when they
wish to express themselves, they act in the here and now.
<P>
  For this reason, it can sometimes be difficult to understand the
ISFP.  Rather than expressing themselves verbally, they act.  Sometimes
they "act" literally, as on the stage; other ISFPs paint, or sculpt, or
draw or sing.  For them, what matters is not thinking, or serving, or
searching for meaning; the force that drives the ISFP is action.  Thus
anyone who wishes to understand the ISFP must examine and interpret the
ISFP's creative actions.  And because interpretation is so subjective,
the ISFP is often misunderstood.  (Usually by the interpreter projecting
his or her own qualities onto the ISFP.)
<P>
  Still, while this can be annoying to ISFPs, it rarely slows them
down.  Understanding would be nice, but it's not a requirement; all that
is really necessary is an audience.  It doesn't even have to be a live
audience.  ISFPs often prefer to do their creating in private, so it is
enough that the work will be seen by someone eventually, perhaps in a
recorded form.
<P>
  Most ISFPs demonstrate a keen awareness of physical reality, yet
have an almost childlike naivete where other people are concerned.  The
typical ISFP will go out of his or her way to exhibit kindness to others
(and thinks that everyone else should, too), most especially when those
others are looked down upon by "normal" society.  Some ISFPs seem to
consider it a matter of honor to stick a thumb in the collective eyes of
society's rule-makers, and so consciously seek out and glorify those who
reject "duty" (as defined by society) in favor of the Perceiving freedom
the ISFP longs to have.
<P>
  At the same time, these ISFPs also tend to possess a refinement of
sensibility to the real world of objects that the other types cannot
match.  An ISFP may be attuned to nuances of color or light or texture,
or be able to pick out a single flawless note in a rushing symphony, or
taste distinctions of flavor or smell differences in fragrance that are
undetectable to anyone else.
<P>
  And once they've noticed these things, ISFPs are often capable of
duplicating them in their own work.  As with the other Sensing
Perceivers, no practice seems necessary; it is as though they were
born knowing how to accomplish these creative expressions.  For the
ISFP, there is no "practice"--there is only "doing."
