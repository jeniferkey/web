  Of all the temperaments, the SJ Guardian is the least complicated and
difficult.  Those with the Sensing Judging temperament live to serve.
</P>

<H4>ESSENTIALS</H4>

<P>
  For Introverted SJs, this usually means personal service; Guardians of
a predominantly Extraverted nature can often be found helping
organizations run smoothly and efficiently.  Either way, the point is to
be of use, to avoid causing trouble or giving offense, to respect
traditions, to protect the current state of things.
<P>
  SJs are the pillars of their communities.  In the home, they have set
rules they expect to be followed; in public, they do their best to
follow the rules of society as they understand those rules.  SJs tend to
believe wholeheartedly in order.  The typical SJ can barely imagine what
it would be like to stand outside of society, to not belong to
something beyond him- or herself.  For the Guardian, life is defined not
by who you are inside, or by what you know, or even by what you do, but
by the steadfastness of your relationships.
</P>

<H4>CHILDHOOD</H4>

<P>
  SJs demonstrate this early in their lives by being "good" children,
who try as hard as they can never to cause problems for their parents or
for anyone else.  Authority figures tend to appreciate the SJ child,
primarily because they are usually tired and stressed out from dealing
with the quirks of the other three temperaments.  Not so with the SJ,
who can be so quietly helpful that they are overlooked.
</P>

<H4>SCHOOL</H4>

<P>
  The same pattern holds true when SJs enter school.  Elementary school
teachers have historically tended to be SJs, and this type finds SJ
children a pleasure to have in their classrooms.  SJ children don't
break down crying at the slightest hint of disapproval as NF children
sometimes do; SJ children don't pester a teacher to distraction by
continually asking "Why? Why? Why?" the way NT children have a habit of
doing; and SJ children (for which the SJ teacher breathes a prayer of
thanks) don't bounce off the walls and stubbornly refuse to learn the
way that SP children are inclined to do.  SJ children, by contrast, tend
to be biddable, attentive students who do their homework on time, follow
all the rules, help wash the blackboard after class, and run for student
office (and win) so that they can be of use to both the faculty and
their fellow students.
</P>

<H4>WORK</H4>

<P>
  Adult SJs take these habits with them into the workplace, where they
are the backbone of any organization.  While the Introverted SJs take
care of the little details everyone else considers beneath them, the
Extraverted SJs are quietly directing resources exactly where they are
needed to meet the expectations of upper management.  Careers that are
often preferred by Guardians include accounting, secretarial work,
shipping clerk or manager, administrative assistant, factory line
worker, nursing, civil service, and teaching.
<P>
  Managers often count themselves fortunate to have SJs on the payroll,
because they know they can count on the SJ to get his or her job done
with a minimum of fuss.  SJ employees tend to be highly reliable; they
truly enjoy doing a job well, even if it's only something as simple as
making sure that all the pages of a photocopied document line up
neatly.  If an SJ notices that the printer has run out of paper, he or
she will refill it without a second thought.  Keeping things running
smoothly is so natural to Guardians that they rarely consider whether or
not there might be a better way to do things.  For SJs, if it's not
broken, it doesn't need fixing.
<P>
  SJ managers are basically SJ employees with more responsibility.  If a
Guardian manager believes that those reporting to him or her need some
guidance, a personal visit with each employee (as an NF manager might
do) or an "all hands" meeting (favored by SP bosses) is unlikely.  The
SJ supervisor instead will almost inevitably choose to develop a new
policy covering the issue in question, which will then be distributed in
written form to each employee's in-box.  While other temperaments might
find this approach boring, they may miss the fact that it has the
advantage of getting the job done--each employee now knows exactly what
is expected.  If the solution is a good one, the problem will not be
repeated.
</P>

<H4>RELATIONSHIPS</H4>

<P>
  SJs bring this same low-key approach to their personal relationships,
where what mates see of the SJ is what they get.  SJs don't pretend to
be any more or less than they are.  This clear-minded steadiness is
often exactly what persons of other temperaments need most, and they
know that the Guardian can always be counted upon to deliver.  SJs may
not demonstrate the rapt devotion of the NF, or the imaginative flights
of the NT, or the unpredictable delights of the SP, but they don't need
to do so.  Very often, knowing that the SJ will be there like a safety
net when he or she is needed is the one thing that gives the other
temperaments the courage to shine.
</P>

<H4>CONCERNS</H4>

<P>
  SJs, like the other temperaments, can create certain kinds of problems
for themselves.  One difficulty particular to SJs is the tendency to
take their premonitions of imminent disaster to extremes.  It is
something of an understatement to say that most SJs tend to be concerned
about the future.  SJ parents are fond of warning their children to save
their money, to be careful when driving, to avoid talking to strangers,
to exercise caution in any of a hundred different ways.  It is often the
case that everything the SJ suggests is simple good sense; the problem
is that it is so one-sided and so continuous.  In extreme cases, SJs can
become so pessimistic and full of dire "doom-and-gloom" warnings that no
one will listen to them at all.
<P>
  Another way SJs can lose out is when they allow others to take
advantage of their service.  The Guardian desire to work hard and take
care of those who truly need help is seen by some as an invitation to
cheat the SJ, or to take more than their fair share of the SJ's energy
and time.  For Introverted SJs in particular, if anyone needs help then
the SJ counts it his or her duty to assist.  SJs can work themselves
into exhaustion this way.
<P>
  But it's not only con artists who use SJs like this.  SJs do so much,
often without directly asking anything in return, that even their own
families find it seductively simple to keep asking the SJ to do more and
more and more.  Some SJs at this point will begin to complain, which can
become an ingrained habit if the situation does not change.  Other SJs
will internalize the strain, turning to alcohol or some other drug to
try to ease the burden.  Like the camel in the story, though, even an
SJ has a limit.  When that final straw is placed on the SJ's back, look
out!  From being calm and reasonable, SJs who have had enough can turn
into raging dragons, flaming everything and everyone in their path with
years of pent-up frustration.
</P>

<H4>SUMMARY</H4>

<P>
  So it's wise for other temperaments to learn to appreciate the
Guardian.  SJs do so much that is necessary, and ask so little in
return; they deserve as much respect as any of the other, flashier
temperaments.
