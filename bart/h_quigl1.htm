<H2>The Features of a Civilization</H2>

<P>
The fundamental tool of any science is measurement.  In order to
know how a thing changes, one must be able to observe and compare the
features of that thing at distinct points in time and space.  So if
history is to be placed on a scientific foundation (Quigley reasoned),
if we are to understand our own civilization by comparing it to others
of the past, then two tasks are necessary.  First, we must determine the
most important features of civilizations in general.  And second, we
must classify each civilization with respect to those features.  Only
in this way, when we compare similar elements to each other, can we have
confidence that we are perceiving real patterns of historical change
instead of noise.

<H3>Quigley's Six Features of Civilization</H3>

<P>
For his analysis, Quigley took pains to state that the particular
features one selects to characterize civilizations is relatively
unimportant.  There might be two, or four, or twenty; what matters is
selecting a feature set whose elements are specific enough to measure
distinct aspects of civilizations, but not so detailed that broad
patterns become lost in the data.
<P>
Ultimately Quigley chose six qualities which, in his view, represented
the salient features of any civilization.  In order from most abstract
to least, they are: Intellectual, Religious, Social, Economic,
Political, and Military.  Define a civilization's achievements in each
of these categories relative to its neighboring cultures at a given
moment in time, and you will have defined that civiliation in a way that
permits the objective comparisons necessary for scientific analysis.

<H3>Six Features of Civilization? How About Eight?</H3>

<P>
Personally, I think Quigley's list of features could be improved.  I
would add two additional features: technology and ethics.
<P>
Quigley described the intellectual aspect of a civilization as "the
need for comprehension," which suggests an emphasis on theory, on pure
understanding of self and world.  This is a useful category.  But a
plow (for example) is not a theory; it is a practical piece of
engineering which Quigley himself names as one of the products of
human effort that has most profoundly affected the progress of
civilizations.  We call this physical/mechanical/engineering aspect of
creative knowledge "technology," and its goal is not so much
understanding the world as controlling it.  This calls for
personalities, skills and sub-cultures that are different in both
process and result from pure intellectual research.  As such, it seems
to me that it ought to be included in any serious attempt to distinguish
one civilization from another.
<P>
As technology is not purely intellectual, ethics (we might also call it
philosophy) is not purely religious.  Like religious expression, ethics
is concerned with human motivation.  But it is one level of abstraction
removed from religion because it does not deal so directly as religion
does with personal motives, but rather seeks to understand the impulses
and restraints common to all humans by virtue of our being self-aware,
reasoning beings.  Where a particular religion states its rules in a
fixed form, offering individuals psychological security derived from the
simplicity of being given directions to follow on the basis of personal
authority, ethical codes are more global and more objective.  Rather
than telling an individual what to do "because I said so," an ethical
code--a philosophy--tells an entire species what to do, because with
sentience comes responsibility.  Thus, like technology and religion,
the relative development of a civilization's ethics is a distinct
analytical feature, which we can profitably add to the six features
propsed by Quigley.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>Why Extend Quigley's Feature Set?</H3>

<P>
But why add to Quigley's list of features at all?  Wasn't he quite clear
that the number of features chosen was relatively unimportant?
<P>
The weasel word there is "relatively."  The two "new" features I propose
using are worthwhile in that they help to distinguish civilizations from
each other without adding unhelpful complexity.
<P>
These reasons are enough, I would say, to justify extending Quigley's
list.  As he pointed out, the particular qualities measured are not the
most important part of historical analysis.  Still, we have to measure
<EM>something</EM>; it seems to me we might reasonably give some care to
the features we choose. If excluding or adding particular features
improves the model, then improve the model.
<P>
I have another reason for extending Quigley's list of measured qualities
as I did, however.  Examining his list, it seemed to me to very nearly
correspond to a list of human personality types.
<P>
For example, the Intellectual quality of a civilization could be
expressed by its members who demonstrate the Myers-Briggs types of ENTP
and INTP, which can be called the Inventor and Designer types,
respectively.  Likewise, the Social aspect seems to be described very
closely by the two Myers-Briggs types of ESFJ and ISFJ (the Protector
and Provider types).
<P>
As I studied Quigley's list, each of the sixteen Myers-Briggs types, in
pairs, seemed to be represented by a feature of a civilization, with the
exception of two pairs of Myers-Briggs types: the xNTJ and xNFP
types.  Given the descriptive names for these types (Scientist and
Engineer for xNTJ, and Monastic and Journalist for xNFP), I realized
that these impulses correspond to the two new features: Technology and
and Ethics.
<P>
I did not rely on the Myers-Briggs model of personality types in my
earlier argument for adding Technology and Ethics to Quigley's list of
features of civilizations that can and should be analyzed.  The
surprising correspondence between Quigley's six features and most of the
Myers-Briggs types is not, of itself, a sufficient argument for changing
Quigley's list of features.  But this correspondence does, I think, add
to the weight of my previous argument: that Technology and Ethics are
features of a civilization that help to more fully define that
civilization without duplicating other features or adding undue
complexity to the underlying model.
<P>
I should add that I am still somewhat tentative about this
correlation. As Quigley pointed out (and I agree), civilizations are
not individual human beings, or even individual living biological
entities--they are civilizations. They have their own high-level rules
of behavior, and those rules may or may not demonstrate lower-level
human personality preferences. Still, I suspect that something like
those personality traits can be observed, given that civilizations,
after all, are made of human beings.
<P>
My revised list of historical features and their corresponding
Myers-Briggs personality types then becomes:
