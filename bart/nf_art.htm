<H3>Overview</H3>

<BR>
<P>
What is art?  "I don't know much about art, but I know what I like."
<P>
I tend to think of Art as including not only the graphic medium,
but sound and writing as well.  But because I discuss the latter forms
elsewhere, in this dicussion I'll stick to talking about "art" as it's
commonly understood: visual fine art.
<P>
Even in this limited form, art is worth study.  As a communicated
representation of internal beliefs, art can provoke, inspire, uplift,
degrade, disgust, glorify, and enlighten... and anything capable of
inciting such a range of reaction is worthy of examination.
</P>

<H3>My Views</H3>

<BR>
<P>
I'll say it right up front: I prefer Realism.  While I can admire Cubism
and Surrealism and Impressionism and so on for experimenting in new
forms of expression, if forced to choose I'll take a Vermeer over a
Mondrian any day of the week.
<P>
Fine art over the past few centuries seems to have gone through three
phases.  In the first phase, the goal of art was to be a reflection of
reality.  The only "message" was explicit in the work's subject.
<P>
In the second phase (whose origin I mark roughly at the early 1800s) art
began to have a symbolic subtext.  Rather than being a direct
communication of a subject to the viewer, valued on the basis of how
accurately the subject was rendered, artists started to play games
with the viewer.  They invited him to replace his objective view of the
work with a subjective view, in which the message was implicit in how
the subject was presented, rather than explicit in the subject
itself.  The subject still mattered, but the self-conscious and
self-referential aspects of the work produced ambiguity in the viewer's
mind about the meaning of the work.  The Impressionists led the way,
followed in a highly conscious manner by Rene Magritte and others.
<P>
In the quest to expand the subjects of art from the real to the
abstract, new forms of representation were required.  To put it less
politely, style began to replace substance.
<P>
By the first third of the twentieth century we saw examples of the
third stage, in which the message is neither explicitly nor implicitly
about the subject at all: modern art is about the artist.  Rather than
a communication intended to stimulate thought or evoke feeling in the
viewer (even if only of uncertainty), the mainstream of today's art is
inward-looking, self-absorbed, and scornful of itself and its viewers.
<P>
The first two words of The Who's rock anthem "Tommy" say it all: "See
me."
<P>
Curiously, this personalization of art leads to two extremes of
interpretation of the function of art.  In one view, style is immaterial;
in the other, style is all there is.
<P>
In the latter case, exemplified by the droppings of Jackson Pollock, the
trippy airbrush art of Peter Max, and the deliberately banal output of
Andy Warhol, the style itself is the subject.  To concentrate solely on
style expresses the artist's nihilistic opinion that content is pointless
because all subjects are worthless.
<P>
In the more serious case where style is completely abandoned, it is
rejected in order to concentrate attention on the true subject: the
artist.  No representational metier is thought to have intrinsic value;
all styles are equally useless because they all take attention away from
the artist.  A style is borrowed or invented only long enough to express
the artist's opinion, then it is discarded as a distraction.
<P>
The result of this personalization of art is to make it impossible to
speak about art itself.  If you criticize a work, you are not simply
stating an opinion about the expression of that work, you are attacking
the artist.  If you question spending tax money on art, you are worse
than a philistine; you are engaging in hate speech.
<P>
This leads naturally to the fourth and final stage of art as predicted
by Spengler.  If art cannot be criticized, then art will be conscripted
by the State because the State does not wish to be criticized.  Art
becomes a tool of propaganda.  From this comes the final decline into
triumphalism and gigantic display, both substance and style stripped of
any power to enlighten.
<P>
I'm hoping Spengler was wrong.  But I wouldn't bet on it.
