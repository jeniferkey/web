<P>
  Thirteen principles for conducting discussions of disputed issues are listed
  below.  Following these guidelines provides two benefits:
</P>
<P>
  One, they are effective.  A discussion using these principles is more likely
  than one which doesn't to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, because the
  principles keep the participants focused less on being "right" or "winning"
  than on coming as close as possible to objective truth.
</P>
<P>
  Two, they are ethical.  They establish a framework for discussion in which it
  is possible for persons to disagree with courtesy, to fairly examine all
  pertinent views so that all participants may profit, and to establish an
  environment in which difficult questions may be asked with some hope of
  gaining insight into their natures--and possibly even their resolutions.
</P>

<H3>1. The Fallibility Principle</H3>
<P>
Admit that you can be wrong.  Judge your own beliefs at least as
critically as you judge those of others.  Be capable of changing your
mind when you encounter an argument more sound than your own.
</P>

<H3>2. The Truth-Seeking Principle</H3>
<P>
Emphasize the following order: Facts, <EM>then</EM> conclusions.  Be
determined to accept good evidence from any source.  When the
preponderance of the evidence favors a conclusion other than your own,
accept that other conclusion . . . and thank whoever helped you reach
it for assisting you in gaining a better understanding of your world.
</P>

<H3>3. The Burden of Proof Principle</H3>
<P>
It's as valid for discussions as for law and debate: The burden of proof
rests with the person who makes the affirmative claim that some thing is
so.  When you make such a claim, be ready to back it up with good evidence
correctly organized; likewise, it is entirely fair to expect the same of
others when they make affirmative claims.
</P>

<H3>4. The Principle of Charity</H3>
<P>
When reconstructing another person's argument for your own understanding,
give the other person the benefit of the doubt.  Don't weaken their
arguments to make them easier for you to knock down.  Doing so just reduces
your own opportunities for a potentially clearer understanding of the
issue.  You don't have to make their arguments for them; just try to view
the arguments they do make in their strongest possible form.  If your
conclusion survives its strongest counterargument, you can feel more
confident about the correctness of your position.
</P>

<H3>5. The Clarity Principle</H3>
<P>
Even better than assuming is to actually ask for clarification when your
understanding of a disputant's position is unclear.  Likewise, always try
to be as clear and concise as possible when presenting your own views.
</P>

<H3>6. The Objectivity Principle</H3>
<P>
Don't take it personally.  Just because someone disagrees with one of
your beliefs doesn't mean that your character is being questioned or
challenged.  There's no need to accept rudeness, but someone who simply
disagrees with one of your opinions is <EM>not</EM> being rude.  To
treat disagreement as though it is a personal attack is a cheap way to
avoid defending your opinions.  If you're going to state an opinion, you
should be prepared to defend it on an objective basis.
</P>

<H3>7. The Relevance Principle</H3>
<P>
The assertions of an argument should be relevant to the question; that is,
they should help to decide the truth or falsehood of the question.
</P>

<H3>8. The Acceptability Principle</H3>
<P>
The assertions of an argument should be acceptable to those involved in
the discussion.  If someone questions an assertion, it should be backed up
with evidence and logic, or else retracted--and if that causes the entire
argument to fail, so be it.  However, that doesn't mean that <EM>every</EM>
assertion should be open to infinite question; some things must be agreed
upon by all parties or discussion becomes impossible.  Be firm about
expecting questionable assertions to be backed up . . . but be reasonable
about it, too.
</P>

<H3>9. The Sufficient Grounds Principle</H3>
<P>
The assertions of an argument should be sufficient to allow participants
of a discussion to decide the question, either "yes, it has been proved"
or "no, it has not been proved" (which is <EM>not</EM> the same as
"disproved").
</P>

<H3>10. The Rebuttal Principle</H3>
<P>
An argument should address as vigorously as possible any counterarguments.
Without doing so, it is not possible to gauge the closeness to objective
truth of your own conclusion.  Likewise, you do others a favor when you
produce the strongest reasonable counterarguments to their arguments, as
doing so gives them something against which to test their own conclusions.
Just as you assist them in testing the worth of their claims, they help
you assess the value of your own.  Encourage responsible counterarguments,
and address them as seriously as you can in your own arguments.
</P>

<H3>11. The Resolution Principle</H3>
<P>
When someone provides relevant, acceptable, and sufficient assertions as
part of an argument for an affirmative claim, and satisfactorily answers
all reasonable objections to both those assertions and the resulting
conclusion, the question should be considered resolved.  If no such
satisfaction proves possible, then the best argument should be accepted
by all the participants on a conditional basis, subject to any new
information which meets all the same criteria.
</P>

<H3>12. The Suspension of Judgement Princple</H3>
<P>
If no position comes close to being satisfactory, of if two or more
positions are found to have equal merit (a rare situation), then the
participants should agree to suspend judgement on the issue.  If events
in the real world require a decision (as, for example, a juror asked to
pass a sentence of death on a convicted murderer might face), then the
question must be decided on the grounds of the risks entailed in
<EM>not</EM> suspending judgement on the question.
</P>

<H3>13. The Reconsideration Principle</H3>
<P>
Humans are finite beings with limited capacities for understanding;
consequently, it is impossible for any of us to fully apprehend objective
truth.  This means that no question can ever be considered completely
settled.  Therefore, if truly new information comes to light concerning
some question which until then had been considered adequately settled
(given our limitations), then we should be prepared to reconsider that
question using all the principles above.
