<H3>ESTJ -- The Administrator [Supervisor]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  Meet an ESTJ, and you will know someone for whom "institutional
responsibility" is paramount, whether the institution in question is
commerce or family life.
<P>
  ESTJs are often found in the mid- to upper-level management of
established businesses.  The ESTJ's responsible nature leads him or her
to provide the direction to keep a business's primary functions running
smoothly.  Combining Sensing (the unquestioned view that perception of
the external world counts for more than internal beliefs) with the
structure-oriented Thinking-Judging preference leads to a type which
prefers to direct activity through the establishment of rules and
procedures.
<P>
  ESTJ-run business groups generally know what is expected of them.  On
those occasions when a novel situation arises, the ESTJ will tend to
want to respond by drafting a memo describing the regulations governing
the situation.  This strength for keeping an institution running as it
has been can become less useful when it is important to respond to a
crisis situation, or to take advantage of a short-lived (but potentially
risky) opportunity.  But once the crisis or opportunity is past, ESTJs
will be there to keep the ship on course.
<P>
  These same tendencies are often found in family settings.  The ESTJ
parent will prefer to have specific rules that family members (both
children and spouse!) are to follow.  Some questioning of the
regulations will be tolerated, but only up to a point.  Questioning an
ESTJ's decisions by those under that ESTJ's direction can sometimes
provoke intensely emotional reactions, as the questioning may threaten
the ESTJ's self-image as the person in charge.  In particular, ESTJs may
have difficulty with Introverted, iNtuitive, or Perceiving subordinates
(whether employees or family members), as each of these preferences is
likely to be interpreted by the responsible ESTJ as "withdrawn,"
"unrealistic," and "lazy," respectively.  No matter what their
temperaments, though, all the children of an ESTJ parent are likely to
grow up full of good advice about how to avoid problems in life.
<P>
  Still, while ESTJs can sometimes find it difficult to appreciate
styles of temperament which differ from their own, an ESTJ is precisely
the kind of person you want in command when seas are calm, rules of
navigation are accepted, and the eventual destination is understood by
all crew members.
