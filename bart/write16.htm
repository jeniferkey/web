  Here's my understanding of these matters.  The word "liberal," in its political sense, has taken some odd twists
  and turns in the few hundred years that we've been using it.  It's now accepted practice in some quarters to
  distinguish between "classical liberalism" and "modern liberalism," and I subscribe to that interpretation.  What
  follow are my opinions, which reflect that bias.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
  The origin of classical liberalism was individual liberty.  (The word liberalism itself, like the word liberty,
  is taken from the Latin word "liber" meaning "free.")  Liberalism was thus the political philosophy that the form
  of government should reflect its function, namely, the liberation of individual human will.  To an important
  degree, classical liberalism was about freedom from government, which by the Age of Enlightenment when classical
  liberal thought flourished was a concept so radical that it bordered on treasonous sedition, punishable by death.
<P>
  This radical notion of deliberately limiting the power of government so as to insure the maximum amount of
  individual liberty was the fundamental basis of the American Revolution and the national constitution which
  created the United States.  The Constitution's primary author, Thomas Jefferson, spent most of his adult life
  in pursuit of that goal; his memorial in Washington, D.C. is engraved with one of his best-known statements
  on the subject: "I have sworn on the altar of God Almighty eternal opposition to all forms of tyranny over
  the mind of man."
<P>
  In short, the original form of the U.S. government was classical liberalism victorious.  Classical liberalism
  had won.
<P>
  And then a funny thing happened.  Over the decades, the liberals at the top of the pyramid--whose job it was
  to keep government big enough to be effective in its few necessary tasks but small enough to leave individuals
  free to handle everything else--began to forget the philosophy behind the power.  So slowly that it was
  imperceptible at any given moment, those entrusted with the power of the state began to use more of it.
<P>
  There always seemed to be a good reason to do so.  Always, state power would only be used to "help."  As the
  years went by, more and more situations provoked government assistance.  Sometimes it was requested, sometimes
  not, but more and more often, it was there.  Gradually, the freedom of individuals to express that freedom
  wasted away through atrophy, or was nibbled away by the well-meaning bureaucrats who came to the seat of
  government and never got up again.
<P>
  And so to the present day.  Immanuel Kant observed that a sufficient change in degree could constitute a
  change in kind, and so it looks to be where liberal government is concerned.  The apparent function of modern
  liberal governments is no longer "freedom from state power," it is now "safety through state power."  Where
  to be "liberal" once meant to believe in the ability of individuals to solve their own problems, the modern
  liberal believes in using the power of the state to solve problems.
<P>
  Communism, socialism, Marxism, the "nanny state," the "welfare state"... all these share with modern
  liberalism the belief that individual abilities, even when voluntarily joined, are inferior in effectiveness
  to state power.  But this is not classical liberalism at all!
<P>
  In a strange way, the roles of conservatives and liberals have reversed.  As the power of the liberal state
  has grown (and corrupted), those who retain the name "liberal" are left in the position of defending the
  power of the state over the individual, while conservatives call for the devolution of power and the
  rebirth of "rugged individualism."  Through scare tactics (the homeless, starving children, overpopulation,
  global environmental "crises," etc.) and promises of wealth redistributed to their supporters, today's
  liberals attempt to justify preserving the power of the state over the individual...
<P>
  ...the exact opposite of the original meaning of "liberalism."
<P>
  As this is indistinguishable from the philosophy of those traditionally seated on the left side in modern
  legislatures, the terms "Left" and "liberal" are today interchangeable.
<P>

<P>
  <I> In Switzerland, we clearly mean what you define as *classical liberalism* when we use that word in
  politics. I believe that the same is true for Germany, and I'm not 100% sure about other European countries. </I>
<P>
  I think I can hazard a guess as to why this may be the case.
<P>
  It basically boils down to Lord Acton's observation that "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts
  absolutely."  It's not a slur of any kind at individual European nations to point out that the United States
  has in this past century become the most powerful nation on the planet--the most powerful organized system
  in human history.  The problem--if you want to call it a "problem"--is that with power comes an overwhelming
  desire to use that power.
<P>
  The fact that it may be wielded in the best of causes to begin with may seem like a good thing at the
  time.  But it sets a precedent; it declares, "I have the power, and you've allowed me to use it for A,
  so now I'm going to use it for B."  Where this gets us into trouble is that little steps <EM>over enough
  time</EM> eventually add up to great distances, and this is particularly true when the effect of each of
  those steps is multiplied by great power.
<P>
  Individual European nations just haven't had that kind of global force to work with.  So from my
  perspective, it stands to reason that the "classical" liberal governments they adopted have not been
  seduced into magnifying the state the way that the U.S. has done.  Without the excuse of "I'm the only
  one who can do this... and it's for your own good," other nations have not had the same degree of
  temptation to become overbearing nannies who think they know what's best for everyone (including their
  own citizens).
<P>
  That temptation is always there, however.  But there is some good news.  I read something the other day
  that encourages me greatly where Switzerland is concerned.  Tell me: Is it really true that Swiss
  jounalists consider the power of their government so weak that they tend to refer to their head of
  state as "our alleged President?" *grin*
<P>
  <I> Do you think it is possible that the word *liberal* has changed to mean what we Europeans tend to
  call *socialistic* in American English because *socialism* is almost considered to be a dirty word? </I>
<P>
  I think we here do tend to equate the words "liberal" and "socialistic."  Not as a deliberate attempt
  to defeat (modern) liberalism purely by linguistic tricks, but because even apolitical citizens can see
  for themselves that modern liberals use the same tactics to get their way as socialists.  In other words,
  the people who've made "liberal" into a bad word are not journalists (who tend to be liberal and thus
  consider "archconservative" to be the nastiest word in the political dictionary), but citizens themselves.
<P>
  It's odd, but in a way there is a war being waged here between private citizens and many of our news
  organizations.  Somehow, many reporters and journalists here have come to believe that it is their
  sacred mission--virtually a crusade--to tell the ignorant populace "what they need to know."  Naturally,
  citizens--who may be ignorant but are not stupid--resent being treated like fools.  And the result is
  that the press is condescending and vain, while private citizens avoid following the day's news
  entirely because they know it can't be trusted to be objective.
<P>
  This is particularly true in political matters, which is part of the reason why voter turnout is so
  low here.  The press put whatever slant on the news will support their own political beliefs, and
  citizens who know they've being cheated avoid politics altogether in disgust.
<P>
  It's an unhealthy situation.  And I mention it to suggest to you that it would be very easy to form
  a distorted understanding of the current U.S. political system--including the conflation of "liberal"
  with "socialist"--based solely on reading U.S. newspapers and watching international editions of CNN.
<P>
  What can be done?  Well, from my point of view, I'm doing it now. *grin*
