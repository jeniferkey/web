<P>
  For the iNtuitive-Thinker, relating to the world is not as important
as understanding its internal logic.  Only when the NT Rational believes
he or she has developed competence in understanding is an NT happy.
</P>

<H4>ESSENTIALS</H4>

<P>
  Competence is a life-long quest for NTs.  At each Rational's heart is
the fear of being exposed to the world as a fraud who doesn't really
know what he or she is talking about.  Consequently the NT is driven
more than any other temperament to learn, to study, to practice, and
to master any and every field.
<P>
  Often enough, the NT succeeds.  An NT may not know everything about
everything (and will engage in ruthless self-criticism for that
"failure"), but he or she will certainly know a great deal about a few
things, and will probably have a basic working knowledge of almost
everything else.  NTs are great planners; they think constantly about
the future and they prepare for it logically by doing everything they
can to become expert in at least one field.
</P>

<H4>CHILDHOOD</H4>

<P>
  As with the other temperaments, a Rational nature is expressed early
in childhood.  NT infants and toddlers amuse themselves by figuring out
ways to get what they want from adults, and parents of an NT will need
to keep an eye out to make sure that their child's curiosity isn't
getting him or her into danger.
<P>
  One of the best ways to identify blooming Rationals is by peeking
into their rooms.  (This is best done cautiously with Introverted NTs,
as they value their privacy tremendously.)  A central feature of any
young NT's room will be a collection of collections.  NTs are born
naturalists, and are likely to have organized collections of rocks,
shells, bones, feathers, fossils, leaves, insects, and even different
kinds of dirt.  Many NTs are also interested in mechanical function,
and expand their collections to include models of cars, trains, space
craft, the human body, dinosaurs, and the solar system.  They also
enjoy jigsaw puzzles, crosswords, and logic puzzles--anything that
allows them to study and understand the nature of a whole thing from
the structure of its parts.  And there is one other thing an NT's
room will usually contain in great abundance: books.
</P>

<H4>SCHOOL</H4>

<P>
  NTs usually do well in school and enjoy being there, primarily because
it's a good place to find books.  A young Rational is likely to know the
Dewey Decimal System but not his or her own telephone number.  Teachers
who appreciate and encourage this insatiable curiosity are likely to be
worshipped by NTs, but other teachers (particularly SJs) may find these
junior scientists, inventors and generals more than they know what to do
with.  There generally are not many NTs in the average classroom, which
means that coursework can seem childish to an NT (who probably studied
on his or her own the assigned material a year or two earlier).  Bored
NTs tend either to "tune out" the classroom--usually with a book--or
else to become fidgety or even emotional and disruptive.
<P>
  Most NTs who can afford to do so attend college.  Graduate degrees are
an NT magnet, particularly for the Introverted NT.  (The extraverted NTs
are usually too anxious to get out into the world and start building
systems to put up with the structure of academia for very long.)  Some
NTs find that the ease with which they breezed through elementary and
high school did not matriculate with them to college, where they are
surrounded by other highly competent NTs.  If these NTs have been
properly prepared for the shock of having to compete, they can excel;
otherwise they may do well in a few subjects and fail ignominiously in
others, simply giving up in order to avoid the embarrassment of failure.
</P>

<H4>WORK</H4>

<P>
  Once they leave the campus--if they ever do; many Rationals find the
university a congenial home--NTs tend to enter white-collar professions
which allow them to indulge their creative, system-building
instincts.  Popular career choices for Rationals include research
scientist, engineer (chemical, electronic, etc.), mathematician, lawyer,
architect, pathologist, historian, computer hardware engineer, software
designer and developer, and R &amp; D team leader.
<P>
  NT employees are happiest when they have the opportunity to create new
things, whether new products, new insights into reality, or new
organizational systems.  They dislike routine, and Introverted NTs
especially prefer quiet environments where they can concentrate without
having to endure constantly ringing telephones and interruptions from
garrulous coworkers.  Although they can let their hair down with close
friends, most NTs prefer to keep their work and their personal lives
separate, with the result that an NT's coworkers can form the impression
that he or she is cold, standoffish, arrogant, rude, impatient,
condescending, and generally unfriendly.  Although they may prefer to
avoid social situations with coworkers, sometimes such mixers help to
dispel these beliefs that Rationals have no feelings and aren't any
fun.  Still, most NTs would rather be evaluated on an impersonal basis;
they wish to be judged on the quality of their work and the cleverness
and utility of their ideas.
<P>
  NTs who enjoy management tend to be ENTJs, but all NT managers tend to
share a gift for visionary leadership.  It is not enough for an NT to
simply keep doing the same things; organizational growth is a critical
interest for these managers.  That means new products, new practices,
new management models, new clients, new services, new ways of doing
business, or else atrophy, decay, and failure.  The Rational manager
doesn't do it simply to make money (corporate or personal), though,
although checking the books is one way to measure success.  More
important to the NT leader is having the opportunity to test hypotheses,
in this case about how best to structure a business.  And an important
part of this is one of the other special gifts of the NT: the ability
to keep in mind the whole while considering the nature of the basic
parts.  More than any other temperament, NT managers are always aware of
the overall goal, and are able to direct low-level activity toward the
successful completion of that high-level goal.
</P>

<H4>RELATIONSHIPS</H4>

<P>
  NTs are generally less successful where personal relationships are
involved.  The competence and authority that allow them to direct the
activity of employees toward a goal do not serve them as well when they
must negotiate on a one-to-one basis as an equal.  NTs are often
unfairly accused of not having feelings; the truth is that persons with
this temperamental preference have feelings as strong as anyone
else's.  What they do not have is the inclination to develop their
expression of those feelings.
</P>

<H4>CONCERNS</H4>

<P>
  For this reason, NTs can make devoted spouses, but have a tendency to
forget to show that devotion unless reminded.  Mates of NTs often
complain of being taken for granted, or that their spouse does not
respect them.  This is due in part to the Rational belief that
redundancy equals rudeness.  A typical NT comment might be, "But I
married you--why do I need to keep telling you I love you?"
<P>
  Another (and possibly more relevant) reason for the Rational coolness
is the NT preference to avoid getting into situations where they feel
expected to "put their emotions on display."  Some NTs have great
difficulty with social situations, particularly very personal moments;
others compensate by studying and practicing what is typically required
of them in such situations.  But all NTs share a deep-seated concern
that, no matter how hard they try, they're doing something wrong, a
feeling which can actually precipitate the nervousness that does indeed
make things go wrong.
</P>

<H4>SUMMARY</H4>

<P>
  If the Rational's heartfelt desire to be seen as competent is
understood, however, and the NT is assured with honesty that his or her
true skills are seen and valued, the rewards will include dedication,
novelty, good humor, prudent foresight... and just maybe an invitation
to share a heart and mind that no one else will ever see.
</P>
