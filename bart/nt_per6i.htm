<H3>ISFJ -- The Conservator [Protector]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  The ISFJ takes a personal interest in ministering to the needs of
individuals.  External institutions are, for this type, not as necessary
a focus as making sure that individual persons are cared for on a
one-to-one basis.
<P>
  ISFJs are generally very dependable.  They take well to routine, and
can be counted on to deliver the things that another person feels are
necessary.  In business, ISFJs can be dedicated teachers; they make
superb personal secretaries and nurses (particularly home care); and
ISFJs are the backbones of most effective religious social service
programs.  They are equally dependable at home, where family members can
always expect to find the yard maintained, food on the table at regular
hours (and in the refrigerator at any time), and clothing and home
furnishings kept clean and in good repair.
<P>
  Unfortunately, this dependability comes so naturally to the typical
ISFJ that it is all too easy for others to take advantage of it.  The
con artist finds the ISFJ an easy mark, but even those who care about
the ISFJ will often find themselves taking the ISFJ for granted.  When
personal services are provided so adequately and without question, it
becomes simple to begin to expect nothing less, even for those who love
that ISFJ.  Often family, friends and coworkers don't even realize when
they are taking advantage of ISFJs, who tend to respond by trying to do
more and more until they either collapse from exhaustion or unleash a
torrent of recriminations that have accumulated over years.
<P>
  This desire to be of service makes the ISFJ, like the ISTJ,
particularly susceptible to relationships with persons who will not
behave responsibly themselves, such as alcoholics, drug users, and
habitual criminals.  An ISFJ will accept the abuser's promise to reform,
providing financial, emotional and physical support.  Then, when the
abuser backslides, the ISFJ will deliver a lecture.  The abuser promises
to reform, and the cycle begins again.  These patterns can be extremely
difficult for an ISFJ to break free of; criticism from other family
members and friends rarely helps.
