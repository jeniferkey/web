<H3>ESFP -- The Entertainer [Performer]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  Life is simple for the ESFP: They want lots of people to enjoy their
performances.  "Performance" may be artistic, as in singing or acting;
or it may simply be doing one's job so well that everyone pays attention
to the ESFP.  Either way, the attention of others is what matters to
persons of this type... no matter what they have to do to get it.
<P>
  One typical expression of this desire is open-handed generosity, not
of what belongs to you but of their own possessions.  If the
Introverted-Sensing-Judging type is the hard-working ant in the old
fable, it's a safe bet that the grasshopper was an ESFP.  Chances are
good, in fact, that the grasshopper had nothing, not because he was too
lazy to gather it but because he gave it all away.  ESFPs love to give
gifts; if holidays or birthdays seem too far away, they will give you
things for no apparent reason at all.
<P>
  The truth, however, is that this really is an exchange.  In return for
their gift to you, they want your attention.  This also drives their
usual choices of careers.  ESFPs can often be found in the public
performing arts, and in social work where their generosity can be
noticed, but they also have a gift for sales.  ESFPs can so dazzlingly
entertain prospective clients that signing a contract seems like a small
price to pay for a continued relationship with someone who shines so
brightly.
<P>
  There is a price to all this, of course.  Without a partner
strong-willed enough to resist the ESFP's many charms, families can find
themselves struggling to make ends meet while the ESFP spends money like
water.  The ESFP can take this even further, refusing to recognize real
problems and preferring to avoid negativity or bad news at all cost.
<P>
  ESFPs also tend to intensify these situations by being occasional
risk-takers.  The mate of an ESFP may find him or her somewhat
unpredictable, which can lead to problems if the ESFP's spouse or parent
tries to get the ESFP to "settle down."  While ESFPs accept this as
attention, they can resent the implication that there is something wrong
with them and lash out with accusations that the other is boring or
controlling, or else absent themselves from the entire environment until
things calm down.
<P>
  But worst of all is to ignore the ESFP.  This is the unforgivable sin,
because it is perceived as a rejection of the ESFP's essential inner
nature.  At best, he or she will sulk; at worst, an ESFP may give in to
the ongoing temptation to indulge in sensual gratifications... perhaps
outside the home, where he or she can find the positive attention
craved.
<P>
  In an environment where the ESFP feels appreciated, however, there is
no limit to the attention which will be lavished on the person who is a
delighted audience.
