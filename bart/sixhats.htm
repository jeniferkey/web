<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
</CENTER>

<BR>
<P>
"Edward de Bono has spent much of his life trying to teach people how to
think."
<P>
When I first heard de Bono's work described this way, I thought it was
incredibly arrogant.  Who does this de Bono character think he is,
presuming to tell me that I don't think clearly?  If he's some genius,
isn't it rude to assert that?
<P>
I did some research.  And it turns out that, while he may not be the
world's most gifted thinker, de Bono is right to say that most people
can learn to think better.  In many cases, this means learning new
styles of thinking.  And that is something from which all of us--myself
included--can benefit.
<P>
For example, it was de Bono who popularized the concept of "lateral
thinking," in which problems are not solved head-on but approached from
novel angles.  Such an approach doesn't make us smarter; it simply makes
more efficient use of whatever intelligence we have.
<P>
And so it is for another of de Bono's concepts: the notion of six
different "thinking hats."  According to de Bono, there are six distinct
styles of thinking.  While most of us tend to prefer one or two styles,
de Bono makes the case that problems can be solved most readily by
applying all six styles.

<H3>THE SIX HATS DESCRIBED</H3>
</CENTER>

<BR>
<P>
In de Bono's scheme, each of us owns six imaginary hats of different
colors.  Each hat represents a different style of thinking, which can be
referred to by observing that one is "putting on" a hat of a particular
color.
<P>
These colors are:

<H3>THREE GROUPS OF OPPOSITES</H3>

In thinking about the six hats, it's often useful to group them into
three sets of two somewhat opposite-styled hats each.

<H4>Red and White Hats: Information Sources</H4>
The red hat and white hat are both used to acquire information relating
to the question at hand.  The red hat focuses on internal, subjective,
personal emotions, while the white hat concentrates on external,
objective information.

<H4>Yellow and Black Hats: Information Analysis</H4>
Both the yellow and black hats are concerned with judging the fitness
of ideas.  But where the black hat focuses on risks and constraints,
yellow hat thinking concentrates on opportunities and benefits.

<H4>Green and Blue Hats: Information Organization</H4>
The difference between the green and blue hats is the difference
between the new and the old, respectively.  The green hat frees the
imagination from old patterns, allowing a focus on results.  And blue
hat thinking structures ideas, allowing a concentration on process.
