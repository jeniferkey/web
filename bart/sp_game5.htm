      Between them, Warcraft and Command &amp; Conquer established the genre
      of Real-Time Strategy (RTS) as one deserving to stand on its
      own.  With their success, imitators followed, each trying hard to
      figure out the most important aspects of their predecessors and
      improve on them.  One of these entries was 1997's Age of
      Empires.  Designed by Bruce Shelley and others who had worked at
      Microprose on Civilization, and distributed by Microsoft (to the
      distress of some who imagine yet another software
      category--games--being devoured by the Monster of Redmond), Age of
      Empires is one of those games that outdoes its elders.  All the
      good things about the earlier games were retained and improved
      on.  It looks better, sounds better, and plays better.  Like Jedi
      Knight and Master of Orion, Age of Empires didn't break new
      ground.  But it did use new technology to make an older game
      better, and did so with style.

      Real-Time Strategy games, like their turn-based cousins, can be
      extremely addictive, and Age of Empires is no exception.  It too
      provokes the "Let me just try this one little thing" response that
      leads to seeing the sun come up in the morning.  In a way, the
      real-time aspect intensifies this feeling.  Either the player is
      busily building up forces to repel or mount an invasion, or else
      he is in the middle of just such an invasion.  In neither case is
      there a clearly defined break point at which it would be natural
      for a player to save the current game until later.  Thus the
      temptation to keep playing (just a little while longer) until the
      end of the scenario is usually very strong.

      Age of Empires comes with four campaigns already designed, each
      of which contains about fifteen scenarios.  Given their number and
      the high level of difficulty of some of them (even when set to
      "Easy" mode), most gamers will find Age of Empires highly
      replayable.  In addition, there are a random scenario builder as
      well as a more complex scenario design tool.

      Part of the fun of Age of Empires (AoE) is being able to replay
      some of the battles of ancient history.  The military similarities
      are virtually non-existent, since units and terrain aren't nearly
      detailed enough to simulate what is known of these early
      engagements.  But of course AoE isn't meant to be a true military
      simulation; it is its own strategy game which simply borrows some
      elements of name and technology from times past.  Even so, it's
      instructive to plunk down a few legionaires into a mass of
      low-tech Gaulish barbarians.  The visual and audio effects show
      off the game technology to good advantage, and there are enough
      different types of units and buildings (many more than in, say,
      Warcraft II) to keep players exploring for resources.  And if
      those explorers happen to bump into a more advanced tribe... well,
      these things happen.  Besides, it might give AoE the chance to
      show off its detailed end-of-scenario statistical screens.  All
      things considered, Age of Empires will more than hold its own on
      the shelf of anyone who enjoys real-time strategy gaming.
