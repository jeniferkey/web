<H2>Quigley's Shadows</H2>

<P>
Those already familiar with Carroll Quigley may be wondering how his
historical theories relate to his other work.  An Excite search on
"Carroll Quigley" revealed some oddities.  Apparently Quigley's long
association with Georgetown University (a nominally Jesuit school) have
led some conspiracy theorists to conclude that he was part of a shadowy
group determined to create a globe-spanning "New World Order," complete
with references to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Knights of
Malta and the Pope.  A couple of other books Quigley wrote (<I>Tragedy
and Hope: A History of the World in Our Time</I> and <I>The
Anglo-American Establishment</I>) are also cited as evidence of a Cecil
Rhodes-based organization to conquer the world (though whether for
utopian socialism or for Western capitalism is unclear). The fact that
Rhodes Scholar Bill Clinton has praised Quigley several times only adds
to suspicions of the Georgetown professor.
<P>
Honesty requires me to note that Quigley did seem to express the view
that a single world government based on Western civilization was the
only way that our civilization could reform itself and avoid the fate of
extinction produced by becoming a Universal Empire.  As Dr. Harry J.
Hogan says in his foreword, "... Quigley perceives--correctly in my
view--the possible termination of open-ended Western civilization.  With
access to an explosive technology that can tear the planet apart, coupled
with the failure of Western civilization to establish any viable system
of world government, local political authority will tend to become
violent and absolutist."  (<I>The Evolution of Civilizations</I>, p.
19.)
<P>
But this viewpoint, it seems to me, fails to realize that a world
government--Western or otherwise--would of necessity be a "Universal
Empire," since by definition there would be no surviving external
cultures, and no periphery.  A single world government is no panacea
for fractious human nature. Messy though it may be, human freedom
requires disorder--systems that are too rigid cannot last.  Both
liberal economic planners and conservative social organizers seem to
ignore this.
<P>
Quigley was too independent a thinker to be neatly classifiable as an
ivory-tower intellectual or doctrinaire leftist.  There is, for example,
his observation (on which he had been working for ten years at the time
of his death) that military technology was closely related to
democracy.  Specifically, Quigley was of the opinion that complex
weapon systems tend to create armies of specialists (such as the Swiss
mercenaries and Italian <I>condottieri</I> of the Medieval period),
which are most easily used by authoritarian and totalitarian regimes.
By contrast, simple but powerful weapons--such as the mass-produced,
breech-loading rifles that anyone could acquire and use--actually
promoted democracy by giving individuals the power to resist
authoritarian coercion.
<P>
As Quigley put it, "The hope of the future [rests] in the invention of
new weapons and new tactics that will be so cheap to obtain and so easy
to use that they will increase the effectiveness of guerrilla warfare so
greatly that the employment of our present weapons of mass destruction
will become futile and, on this basis, there can be a revival of
democracy and of political decentralization in all three parts of our
present world."  (<I>The Evolution of Civilizations</I>, p. 403.)  This
common-sense affirmation of the importance of the Second Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution is (it hardly bears saying) not in line with the
beliefs of left-leaning gun-control advocates.  This makes it difficult
to pigeon-hole Quigley politically.
<P>
So, what to make of <I>The Evolution of Civilizations</I>?  Does it
stand on its own, or is it a thinly-veiled and speciously argued
rationalization for a single World Government?
<P>
Until I see credible evidence for the latter, I think I'll just treat
Quigley's scientific study of history as another in the long line of
attempts to understand our society and predict its likely future.  The
success or failure of this attempt rests solely on its own merits.
