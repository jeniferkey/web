<P>
  I haven't seen <I>G.I. Jane</I>.  But I've heard plenty.  So just what is it that bothers me about this movie?
<P>
  It is this: Great fiction is about realistic people in realistic situations. Good fiction puts realistic people into
unrealistic situations.  Mediocre fiction populates realistic situations with unrealistic people.  Bad fiction is
unrealistic, period.
<P>
  Modern Hollywood is most often mediocre at best.
<P>
  By "realistic" I don't mean "it's possible in this universe."  I simply mean that it's consistent with the rules of
the universe in that work of fiction.
<P>
  Look at what separates good fiction from bad.  It isn't the scenery--it's the characters.  If the characters resonate
with readers as real, then that fiction succeeds whether it's set in the factual pre-Communist Russia of <I>Anna Karenina</I>
or the wholly imaginary Middle-Earth of J.R.R. Tolkien.
<P>
  OTOH, Hollywood these days--particularly in television--isn't about real people.  It's about superheroes (and, of course,
superheroines).  Most often, it's about taking some realistic scenario which the movers and shakers don't like--the all-male
military, for example--and criticizing it by creating unrealistic characters whose purpose is to act as mouthpieces for the
enlightened.
<P>
  Thus we get mothers who are "enlightened" by the tragic deaths of their gay serviceman sons into "tolerance" of behavior
which mainstream America rejects but which the vocal gay lobby (which exercises considerable power in the arts community
including Hollywood) endorses.  Almost a made-for-TV movie cliche by now, the scenario is realistic but the character on
whom Hollywood wants us to focus is not.  Real people are capable of nuance; they can love a person even when they continue
to think that that person's actions are wrong.  Hollywood doesn't care to show us such real people because that undercuts
the message we're supposed to get.
<P>
  Similarly, the most popular villains in movies today are corporate executives--almost always white males.  The flaming
hypocrisy of the multi-billion-dollar film industry (run almost exclusively by white males) aside, most of Hollywood's
decision-makers refuse to acknowledge that the real people who create the jobs that allow employees to earn the money to go
watch movies are corporate executives... and, very often (though less so these days), they are also white males.  But does
Hollywood offer us realistic portrayals of these owners and operators of businesses?  Not very often, no.  Realistic
businessmen and -women are not welcome because they undercut the message that employers are usually Bad People out to screw
the noble workers.
<P>
  (Pro-environmentalism message movies like <I>Free Willy</I> and <I>Fern Gully: The Last Rain Forest</I> are left as an
exercise for the student.)
<P>
  The "unrealism" that most of today's Hollywood protagonists share--the characteristic that sets them apart from realistic
fictional characters--is that they are artificially created heroes.  They are extraordinary people... just as their Hollywood
creators see themselves as extraordinary (i.e., heroic) persons for the unpopular causes they champion.  These characters do
the things they do--and, importantly, are rewarded in the end for having done so--in order to stroke the egos of their creators.
<P>
  Realistic characters, by contrast, aren't extraordinary.  They're ordinary people, just like you and me, who are forced by
circumstances into making hard choices where no "happy ending" may be possible.  No glory accrues to their creators as a
result of the actions of the characters; the goal is not to teach the public to share the creator's belief in some "fact"
(say, "women have an equal right to be U.S. Navy SEALs"), but to offer insights into what it means to be human.
<P>
  Not male or female, not black or white, not gay or straight, not merely a representative or patron of some "politically
oppressed" group--but human.
<P>
  When Hollywood shows us people just tying to be human, and lets us form our own opinions as to the meaning of their
struggle; when the characters are real, not message-toting sock puppets; when the protagonist's most difficult struggle is not
with some villain from Central Casting, but with recognizing and overcoming his or her own weaknesses...
<P>
  ...that's good fiction.
