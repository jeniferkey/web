<H3>The Prisoner's Dilemma</H3>

<P>Axelrod began by considering the &quot;Prisoner's
Dilemma&quot; experiment. This is a kind of thought game which
examines the rewards and punishments for either cooperating or
not. The story usually given runs like this:
<P>
Suppose you and an accomplice (whom you barely know) in some
crime are arrested. The chief detective visits you. He says,
&quot;We know you and your pal did it. And you're both going to
jail for it. But we always like to make sure, so you've got a
choice. You can tell us what your pal did, or you can keep quiet.
(And by the way, we're giving him this same choice you're
getting.)&quot;
<P>
&quot;If you give us evidence against him, and he keeps quiet
about you, then you get one year, and he spends six behind bars.
If you keep quiet and he gives us the goods on you, you stay for
six and he's out in one. If you both keep quiet, you both get
three years; if you both turn each other in, you both get five
years. So what'll it be?&quot;
<P>
You must select one of two options--you can either cooperate
with your fellow prisoner (by keeping quiet) or defect (by
providing evidence). You have no way of passing information
between you, and you don't know him well enough to predict what
he'll choose based on his personality. So which will you choose?
<P>
The table below describes what is called the &quot;payoff
matrix&quot; of this classic formulation of the Prisoner's
Dilemma:

are categorized as follows:</H5>

Try it for yourself.  Here's a link to an on-line version of the

<A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/~mdaniels/PD/PD.html" TARGET="NEW">Prisoner's Dilemma</A>.

<P>
Looking at the table in a purely rational way, it would seem
that your best choice is to defect. The two possible results of
your defection mean a chance for jail time of either 1 year (if
your compatriot cooperates by keeping quiet about you) or 5 years
(if he talks), for an average risk of 3 years. On the other hand,
if you cooperate with your accomplice, you get 3 years if he
cooperates too and 6 years if he defects, for an average risk of
4.5 years.
<P>
What's more, you have to assume that your accomplice is
capable of thinking about this just like you did. Since he--just
like you--is likely to conclude that defection is less risky,
he'll probably defect... in which case you have even less
incentive to cooperate.
<P>
And so you defect. And so does your accomplice. And so you
both come away worse off than if you had cooperated with each
other.
<P>
It appears that as long as the temptation to defect is greater
than the reward for cooperating, there's no reason to cooperate.
Yet it's clear that in the real world we do cooperate. So could
there be some other factor at work, the addition of which to the
Prisoner's Dilemma might make its outcomes more realistic?
