<P>
  Action!  That's the key to the SP.  When the Artisan steps into the
room, stand back, because something is about to happen.
</P>

<H4>ESSENTIALS</H4>

<P>
  The combination of Sensing and Perceiving leads to a temperament that
insists on experiencing everything the world has to offer.  Limits are
for other people; the Artisan chafes when prevented for any reason from
action.
<P>
  And the action does not have to be for anything--simply acting is
its own rationale.  For the SP, being able to do a thing is reason
enough to do that thing.  Later in life, SPs may curb their impulsive
tendencies somewhat, but the young SP simply will not be restrained
from doing whatever looks like fun at the moment.
</P>

<H4>CHILDHOOD</H4>

<P>
  This begins early, too.  Infants who will later prove to be SPs often
begin walking before others do.  They are not likely to enjoy being in
a crib, either, which they regard as the cage it resembles.  But where
the NT child gets into things in order to satisfy a burning curiosity,
the SP toddler runs around like a wild thing for no other reason than
because he or she can, and thus bears at least as much close watching
as the NT.
</P>

<H4>SCHOOL</H4>

<P>
  When old enough for school, an SP's parents are usually more than
happy to wave bye-bye for a few hours every weekday.  Not that the SP is
likely to notice, as long as there are lots of new things to see and do
in the new environment.  This can actually be a source of concern to
some parents, who misinterpret the SP child's independence as a lack of
love or caring for them.  But the SP is simply doing what is natural;
namely, pushing the limits.
<P>
  In adolescence and teenagers, this can become a serious problem,
especially if the parents are SJs with their strong sense of proper
behavior.  SJ parents are likely to consider an SP's exuberance a
deliberate challenge to their authority, and respond with rules and
regulations and restrictions and curfews and limits... all of which the
SP will eventually ignore.  During the process, it is unfortunately all
too likely that both parents and child will become estranged, each
convinced that the other is willfully trying to inflict pain as the
fighting spirals out of control.
<P>
  Meanwhile, school is likely to be one of the prime sources of
contention.  Far too often, SP children are diagnosed as "hyperactive,"
or "learning-disabled," or "dyslexic," or suffering from "Attention
Deficit Disorder" and pumped full of Ritalin and other drugs.  In fact,
they are not "suffering" from any ailment or deficiency at all; they are
simply being themselves, and that means learning not from books or
lectures but by doing.  But because most educators have tended to be
SJs, there is no escape for Artisans at school, either.  They learn
quickly that school is just another place full of rules and regulations,
where you have to sit still for hours and hours and never get to do
anything.  It is no wonder that SPs tend to fail more classes than they
pass, and are promoted up and out because most teachers simply don't
know what else to do with them.
</P>

<H4>WORK</H4>

<P>
  Only after reaching young adulthood are SPs finally able to begin to
chart their own courses.  Still tasting the bitterness of formal
schooling, most SPs will avoid college and even technical training in
favor of apprenticeship in a trade.  ISTPs and ISFPs will take up tools
as if born to them, while ESTPs and ESFPs will quickly manage to talk
employers into taking them on.  Even here, though, the SP will resist
too much structure.  Being able to choose their own job helps, and most
SPs will manage to accept some business rules in order to keep doing
something they enjoy.  But few SPs will long be satisfied with an
employer that doesn't give them the freedom to test their capabilities
from time to time.  Jobs which SPs tend to prefer include park ranger,
professional athlete, artist, the military, builder, firefighter,
machine operator, police officer, surgeon, and entertainer.
<P>
  There are two other jobs in particular which give the flavor of what
being an SP is all about.  One of them is sales.  SPs tend to do
phenomenally well in sales, especially the ESTPs.  Few things get an
SP's juices running like going head-to-head with a reluctant potential
client.  This real-time, face-to-face negotiating, which calls for being
able to read reactions precisely and instantaneously, is like water in
the desert to an SP; at no other time does he or she feel so alive.  A
second field in which SPs can work what look to other temperaments like
miracles is what might be called Troubleshooting.  When a company or
business group is "sick," when it is failing to perform some necessary
task, that's when smart companies call in a business-savvy SP.  These
men and women are like the hired guns of the Old West--they saddle up
and ride into town, take on the bad guys (whatever that may translate
into in a business setting, even if no individuals are actually "bad"),
then ride off into the sunset in a blaze of glory to the next town.
<P>
  SP managers are usually not quite so dramatic, but even they have
their moments.  When action is called for, the SP manager will be there,
ready to take on anyone and everyone until the problem is solved.  In
fact, one problem SP managers face is their tendency to overreact to
minor problems, simply because they're bored and looking for something
they can do to showcase their gift for averting crises.  (It has been
observed that some SPs, when it's been too long since the last crisis,
will actually create their own crises to solve.)  SP leaders can also
get themselves into trouble by ignoring details in order to focus on
"the big picture," or, paradoxically, by attempting to micromanage every
single detail, thus missing the overall goal.
</P>

<H4>RELATIONSHIPS</H4>

<P>
  Some of these same traits are visible in the SP's personal life.  As
SJs are perpetual pessimists, SPs are the eternal optimists.  No matter
how terrible things may seem at any given moment, an SP will confidently
predict that great times are just around the corner.  And with their
silver tongues, Extraverted SPs often seem to be correct in these
predictions more times than not.  Then, just as quickly, the SP's
generous nature and propensity for risk-taking will cause him or her to
gamble everything on a single throw of the dice.
<P>
  This "live-for-the-moment" approach to life can be hard on other
temperaments, particularly the "save-for-a-rainy-day" SJs.  An SP will
certainly bring excitement into anyone's life, with glamour, jewelry,
fast cars, fine dining, and exotic travel (for as long as the money
holds out).  And the SP's "life is an adventure" theme song will make
even apparent disasters seem like no more than bumps in the road.
</P>

<H4>CONCERNS</H4>

<P>
  But there is a flip side to this tune.  When things really do go
wrong, the SP is capable of cutting his or her losses and disappearing
without a word.  More than any other temperament, the SP's intense
longing for the freedom to act enables him or her to treat any ties,
emotional or otherwise, as purely matters of convenience.  As long as
it suits an SP, he or she may follow every rule laid down, do everything
expected, cross every "t" and dot every "i."  But when it ceases to
suit, the SP can simply say "goodbye" and walk out the door into the
next adventure.  There may be a few moments of regret that things didn't
work out, but these are soon lost in the glare of the next challenge.
</P>

<H4>SUMMARY</H4>

<P>
  Many SPs do manage to find ways to compromise, though, trading a
little freedom for a steady job and a stable family life.  As long as
the SP is left free to break away for some adventure now and then, and
honestly appreciated for the boldness, bravery, cleverness, endurance,
and sheer zest for life that he or she brings to the party, life with
an SP can truly be the rich adventure promised.
