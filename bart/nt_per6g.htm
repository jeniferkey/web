<H3>ISTP -- The Artisan [Instrumentor]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  Typical ISTPs are unlike all the other types in two particular ways:
they crave excitement, and they are the consummate tool-users.
<P>
  To the ISTP, action is not "for" anything; action itself is the
ultimate goal.  An ISTP does not ask someone else, "May I?"  An ISTP
asks him- or herself, "Can I?"... and then proceeds to go find
out.  This often involves testing oneself against something, be it
nature (mountain climbing, snowboarding, skydiving) or other human
beings (fencing, auto racing, football).  Testing the limits to produce
that adrenaline rush is the summit for ISTPs.
<P>
  Even if they work in an office in a 9-to-5 job, ISTPs will figure out
ways to make the job more "interesting."  This may mean putting off
writing a report until the last minute, or going after a client
everyone else has given up on, or cornering the company president to
pitch an idea.  To the ISTP, the only things that are impossible are
the things no one has yet tried to do... and the ISTP usually thinks he
or she could accomplish those, too.
<P>
  ISTPs, particularly later in life, are sometimes mistaken for their
close typological relatives, the ESTPs.  But the two types differ in at
least one significant way, and that is the ISTP's complete facility
with tools.  As naturally as the INTP manipulates ideas, and the ISFP
understands sensory information, the ISTP uses tools as though born to
them.
<P>
  As an INFP is impelled to question his or her own nature, the ISTP
feels drawn to tools.  If it can be used to manipulate the world, or
to permit greater freedom of action, the ISTP will usually seem to know
how to use it within minutes after first encountering it.  This
tendency is seen even in the very young; ISTP children are usually
found with some kind of implement in their hands, busily building (or
destroying!) something.
<P>
  This creative/destructive dichotomy is central to the ISTP.  Many
ISTPs are builders of homes, skyscrapers, engines, and other physical
things.  And many ISTPs are warriors, since one of the tools with which
ISTPs can be shockingly proficient is the weapon.  An ISTP may not be
able to quote Shakespeare, but let an ISTP hear the words, "...we few,
we happy few... we band of brothers..." and he or she will understand
the fraternal understanding of which the Bard wrote.
<P>
 Close relationships can be difficult for ISTPs.  A relationship, by
its very nature, implies a kind of bond.  But to be bound in any way is
painful to the ISTP; he or she simply will not recognize any union
except on his or her own terms, and those terms are likely to be
extremely flexible.  Anything which restricts the freedom of movement
of the ISTP is suspect, and will be avoided.  In this way, persons who
try to hold on to ISTPs by squeezing them closer will be disappointed
in the results.  Either the ISTP will simply refuse to acknowledge the
hold and disappear like smoke, or--when the bond is one that cannot be
ignored--ISTPs will turn and fight like tigers, furious at being caged.
