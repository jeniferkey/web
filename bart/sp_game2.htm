      Civilization didn't push any technology envelopes.  But it was the
      first game to bring "conquer-the-world" strategy gaming to the
      masses.  Previously this genre had been limited to mainframe games
      such as Empire; the only similar games for consumer machines were
      wargames.  But as these appealed primarily to those who were
      familiar with rules-laden miniatures gaming, they never caught on
      with the public.  Civilization changed that by simplifying the
      combat rules and adding exploration and "research" of new and more
      powerful technologies.  The result was a game that singlehandedly
      expanded a genre into profitability.

    <TD>
      The simplicity of control in Civilization was key to its very high
      addictiveness.  As a strategic game, long-term planning was
      important, so there was always an impulse to play one's plans
      through to determine their outcome.  But what made that so
      tempting was how simple it was to do so.  A turn generally
      consisted of moving a few units around on the map, and possibly
      changing a tax/science/luxuries rate or choosing a new technology
      to research.  With very little to do in most turns, it was easy to
      say, "Well, I'll just make this one move."  Then the game would
      react to the player's moves, and the player would think, "Hmm, I'd
      better deal with that threat before I sleep and forget my
      strategy... OK, just one more move...."  The next thing the player
      would see was the sun peeking through an east-facing window.

    <TD>
      Civilization came with several pre-built scenarios that recreated
      various historical conflicts.  This led to some replaying, but
      more effective was Civilization's random map builder.  This
      allowed the player to generate different kinds of maps: ones which
      traded off good farmlands for lots of metals, or which tended to
      produce a few giant continents or many isolated islands.  This
      dramatically enhanced Civilization's replayability.  Every game
      would require different tactical choices, while still allowing a
      grand strategy to be formulated and tested.

      Although a sequel to Civilization was released, in many ways it
      merely improved the graphics and tweaked a few unit values.  The
      original game, years later, is still highly playable... and given
      the speeds of modern processors, the long waits while the moves of
      computer players were processed are over!

      "Conquer-the-galaxy" games had been around for a while when Master
      of Orion was introduced.  MOO (as it quickly became known) merely
      used the latest video technology to display star system
      information.  Where MOO deviated from what had gone before was in
      its merger of the old galaxy-conquering themes with the approach
      taken in Microprose's hit game, Civilization: explore, defend
      territory, and improve technology so as to gain better defenses
      and weapons.  (This model has now become known as "4E"--Explore,
      Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate.)  Like Jedi Knight, MOO didn't
      do any one new thing; it simply took a number of related old
      things, combined them in a consistent way, and did them all well.

    <TD width="20%"><B>Addictiveness: High</B></TD>
    <TD>
      One feature MOO shared with its sibling product Civilization was
      employing a simple user interface to control game units possessing
      varying tactical strengths and weaknesses.  This format ensured
      the necessary basis of addictiveness: high interactivity with
      unpredictable results.  Each unit was simple to move, but doing
      so might cause new information to be obtained or a battle to be
      joined.  This is highly interactive in that many small things need
      to be done, and doing each one results in rapid feedback of an
      unexpected nature.  In other words, the player is always doing
      something, and the results of that action tend to be surprising;
      this motivates the player to keep finding out what will happen
      next.

    <TD width="20%"><B>Replayability: High</B></TD>
    <TD>
      Again, like Civilization MOO could generate random fields of play;
      this allowed consistent strategies to be tested.  In addition, MOO
      included the notion of player races, each with different strengths
      and weaknesses.  This permitted the development of new strategies
      in different games, since what worked with one set of advantages
      and disadvantages might not work under other conditions.

    <TD>
      Like Civilization once more, a sequel to Master of Orion was
      released.  But while it included more thoughtful improvements than
      those of Civ 2, it still did the same things as the original
      MOO.  Because the original was such a strongly addictive and
      replayable game, it still holds up well even when compared to its
      flashier remake.
