<H3>The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma</H3>

<P>This is where Robert Axelrod enters the story. He considered a
possibility others had suggested: What if instead of a single
chance to cooperate or defect, you and an ally had numerous
opportunities on an ongoing basis? Would that affect your choice
on any single interaction?
<P>
Suppose you arrange to sell to a fence some stolen goods you
regularly receive. To protect you both, it is agreed that while
you are leaving the goods in one place, he will leave the payment
in another place. At each exchange, each of you will have to
decide whether to cooperate by leaving the goods or the money, or
to defect by picking up the goods or the money without leaving
anything of your own. Furthermore, each of you knows that this
arrangement will continue until some unspecified time; neither of
you knows when or if at some future date the exchanges will
cease.
<P>
Assume that the payoff values remain the same as in the basic
Prisoner's Dilemma. Does your strategy of defection in the
earlier one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma change in an environment of
repeated interactions with the same individual?
<P>
In 1979, Axelrod devised an ingenious way of testing this
possibility (known as the &quot;iterated&quot; Prisoner's
Dilemma). He contacted a number of persons in various
fields--mathematicians, experts in conflict resolution,
philosophers--explained the payoffs, and asked each of them to
come up with a strategy for a player in an interated Prisoner's
Dilemma tournament that could be encoded in a computer program.
<P>
No limitation was placed on strategy length. One strategy
might be as simple as &quot;always defect.&quot; Others might
take into account their memory of what the other player had done
on previous turns. &quot;Always cooperate but with a random ten
percent chance each encounter of defecting&quot; would be still
another strategy, and so on.
<P>
Axelrod collected 13 such strategies and encoded each of them
in the form of a computer program. (He also added one strategy of
his own, which randomly chose cooperation or defection on each
turn.) He then began to pit each of the 14 strategies against
every other strategy over 200 iterations. This would determine if
any one strategy would prove to do well against all other
strategies (as measured by average payoffs to that strategy).
<P>
The winner was the shortest strategy submitted. It consisted
of four lines of BASIC code submitted by psychology and
philosophy professor Anatol Rapaport of the University of Toronto
in Ontario, Canada. In its entirety it consisted of the
following: Cooperate on the first turn, then in all subsequent
turns do whatever the other player did on its previous turn. This
strategy was dubbed &quot;Tit for Tat&quot;.
