<A HREF="r0001685.htm#f25">25</A>.  <A NAME="f25b"></A>&quot;On June 30, 1887, George Lee Robertson, a native of Covington County, Mississippi,
was united in marriage with Mary Missouri Morgan, of Rapides Parish, Louisiana. The ceremony was performed by Reverend J.P. Patton at the
home of A.J. Willbanks. He was the eldest son of George Granberry and Amanda Chambers Robertson, originally from Mississippi and who had
subsequently moved to Louisiana. She was the daughter of John and Marcia Chambers. Witnessing the marriage at the Willbanks home were Mr.
and Mrs. A.J. Willbanks and S.D. Willbanks. &quot;From this union 15 children were born, eight daughters and seven sons. All children, as far as
can be determined, were born at Nugent, in Grant Parish, Rt. 2 Pollock, Louisiana. The family home where they grew up was situated on the
Grant and Rapides Parish line, which led to the oft-repeated statement by the growing boys [heard more than once by this grandson of D.L.
ROBERTSON -- WBS] that they &quot;ate in Rapides and slept in Grant.&quot; [Note: this home is still standing and can be seen from La. Hwy. 165
which runs between Alexandria and Monroe, La. -- WBS, 02/11/1994] &quot;The family grew up on a small farm on an 80 acre homestead divided by
the Iron Mountain Railroad, later renamed the Missouri Pacific (MoPac). Robertson Road extends on line of Rapides and Grant Parish. What
little extra money there was came from George's work in the commissary of the Nugent Lumber Co., at the mill or, later, from small amount he
was paid for Notary Public work. He also served as trustee of Ball School. &quot;As the older children grew up there was additional family
income from wages for work on the railroad and from school teaching. All adult girls and Ernest have taught public school in the earlier
years -- Rapides, Grant, Webster Parishes. &quot;A study of the family clearly shows that while the small farm was the basic provider for the
family, George was never really satisfied nor interested in farming as an occupation. Family records show numerous incidents which indicate
that his basic interest and abilities were in legal work or in writing. There seems to be little doubt that, had it been possible for him to
receive legal training before or while raising a family his life may have been happier and probably the family income would have been
greater. Ambition and interest was above average in education. &quot;On the other hand there are many samples of his writing showing and unusual
'knack' for word usage. Further, family records bear out that he loved to write. There are poems and other writings, all of which indicate
that he must have had a 'flair' for writing. Records indicate also that this writing ability was recognized by relatives and friends, many
of whom called on him to write obituaries for deceased relatives and friends. &quot;Later, when the small farm eroded because of the little
known or practiced soil conservation, and with top soil gone, could no longer support the family, the income of the older children helped
with family expenses, medical bills and education expense for the younger children. In later life George, with financial support of a son,
Ernest, tried his hand, unsuccessfully, at operating a restaurant and later operating a grocery store. Both were located at Paradise, a
small community on Highway 165 between Alexandria and Pollock named by George L. Robertson. For this occupation, while he was very
interested, he was not ideally suited by temperament, health and training. Further, his faith in his fellow man and desire to help the
unfortunate led to many losses that he never recovered. Illness finally forced him to give up operation of the store. &quot;By the time some of
the younger children arrived, the older members were getting married and having children of their own. &quot;As for the mother of the family,
Mary, her life seemed to have been one of perpetual activity. Her family leadership in many activities especially in religious training and
education of the family seems very evident. It was around her that the family rallied in time of trouble, and it was to her that many of the
family looked for leadership. What with having 15 children, cooking for a growing family, washing, housekeeping, milking the cows, doing the
gardening to feed the family and still helping in the field, her life was never quiet or dull. And yet there always was time for active
church participation.&quot;

<A HREF="r0001685.htm#f30">30</A>.  <A NAME="f30b"></A>&quot;Aberdeen Paul Robertson, beloved and adored son of George L. and Mary M. Robertson,
and the faithful and devoted husband of Lottie R. Robertson, died in St. Francis Sanitarium, Monroe, Louisiana, on Friday morning, November
7, 1924, at 2:36 o'clock. His death resulted from an accident which occurred on Monday November 3, about 5:30 p.m. in the yards of the
Missouri Pacific Railway Company, at Monroe, in which, while holding to the ladder of a moving car, his left arm struck the rafters of the
shed in the yards, knocking him asunder from the car, and he fell, striking his head upon the brick pavement, receiving a severe bruise and
laceration on the right side of the upper cranium. He was conveyed to the sanitarium where he received attention of physicians and the
attendance of efficient nurses. &quot;Although unconscious from the moment struck, his appearance otherwise was that of unbroken normality, and
for three days sanguine hopes of his recovery were fostered by his loved ones and friends who visited his bedside. But later investigation
revealed a fracture in the skull and hemorrhage in the posterior and base of the brain, and withing a few hours following the operation of
removing blood-clots there-from, an ominously unfavorable change of symptoms developed, and in the early hours of this fatal morning, his
soul passed to 'THE GREAT BEYOND,' stemmed the 'VALLEY and SHADOWS of DEATH,' and traversed the cold stream of 'JORDAN,' and entered into
that 'HEAVEN of REST' prepared for 'THE REDEEMED.' &quot;Thus ends a human career comprising the space of thirty-four years, two months and one
day, which is truly illustrious and exemplary that his youth and adolescence encountered environment insuperable and the emediments of
narrowly limited opportunities. &quot;At the time of this most tragical and untimely event, which not only precipitated his loved ones into
heart-rending anguish, but also casts a pall of sorrow over the whole community, he was residing in Eldorado, Arkansas, and was in the
employ of Missouri Pacific Railway Company, in which vocation he had continuously remained from his earliest adult days, having achieved
marked success and efficiency, performing the function of roadmaster for almost four years. &quot;Paul was born September 6, 1890, at northern
boundary of Rapides Parish, ten miles north of Alexandria, Louisiana, and here nurtured and reared to adult age and stature by fond and
devoting parents, whose comfort and welfare were the prime object of his deepest solicitude at all times. He received his Christian double
name in honor of the late ABERDEEN WILSON STEWART of Pollock, Louisiana, and his great-grandfather, the late ASAPH PAUL ROBERTSON [actually
Asaph POWELL Robertson -- WBS] of COVINGTON COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI, respectively. Quite early in life he trusted JESUS CHRIST and was baptized
into the membership of Sardis Missionary Baptist Church, subsequently transferring by letter to KITCHEN CREEK CHURCH of the same faith. &quot;On
April 30, 1911 he wedded Miss Lottie Robertson, whose character, personality and life record is a living monument of honor to the highest
standards of feminine rectitude, virtue and refinement. &quot;His remains arrived over the Missouri Pacific at the home of his childhood on
Friday night at 8:45 o'clock, lying in state until Sunday at 11 A.M. and, during this interval, countless tokens of love and condolence came
to the solemn chamber of the dead and were laid at the shrine. As we viewed his lifeless features for the last time, on which rested no
shadow of an unhallowed thought, but, instead, the indelible imprint of perfect love and trust in Him who doeth all things well, good will
to man, absolute resignation to the immutable decrees of nature in sublime sacred halo, we thought it the sweetest visage we ever looked
upon. &quot;He leaves his beloved wife and four children, namely, Agnes, Lee, Bruce and Norvell, respectively; also on senior and five junior
brothers, namely, Grover, Ernest, Wilson, Idolia, Wilmer and Donald, respectively, and six sisters, namely, Mrs. Gertrude Gunter, of Dallas,
Texas, Mrs. Amanda Roy, of Cedar Grove, Louisiana and Misses Ethel, Zetta, Vivian and Geneva Robertson, respectively. &quot;The funeral
solemnities were conducted by his life-long and beloved pastor, who, in the presence of a vast assembly of sorrowing friends and kindred,
delivered a most appropriate and impressive discourse, after which members of Curtis T. Hines Lodge No. 317, F. &amp A. M., of which order the
deceased was an honored and esteemed member, in a body took charge of the obsequies. Six of their number acting as pall-bearers, bore the
remains to the grave and performed the funeral rites of the order, during which ceremony a number of the members of the Alexandria Klan No.
12 of the K.K.K., marched in file to the grave and performing their ceremonial tributes to the dead, kneeled around the grave and uttered a
fervent prayer, then arose and in file departed, and the Masonic brethren proceeded to make interment, at the conclusion of which the
benediction was pronounced by Elder J. H. Coulson, which and a magnificent and luxurious decoration of floral tokens of love offerings were
lavishly placed on the silent mound so covered, it entirely concealed the mound. &quot;    ONE WHO LOVED HIM &quot;   HIS FATHER GEORGE LEE
ROBERTSON&quot;
[from Lee Wyatt ROBERTSON:] Aberdeen Paul ROBERTSON was born near Nugent, La. He received little formal education--possibly 8th or 9th grade
equivalent--and began working for the Missouri Pacific Railroad on section gang as a youth. While still in his teens, he became a section
foreman, as did his elder brother, Grover. Desiring to marry his first cousin, he wrote to lawyers in various states in order to ascertain
where such a marriage could be contracted; Louisiana law prohibited marriage of first cousins. Mississippi had no such law, and he married
his cousin, Lottie, at Vicksburg on April 30, 1911. On January 15, 1912, they produced the first grandchild, Agnes, on both sides of the
family. (Paul's elder brother, Grover, had married almost a year before Paul; Lottie was the first to marry in her family.) About 1920, Paul
was promoted to roadmaster from section foreman, and was assigned to the MoPac's branch line from Gurdon, Arkansas to Collington, La.; he
moved his family from that house built about 1916-17 on Grant/Rapides parish line to El Dorado, Arkansas, thence to Smackover, thence back
to El Dorado. About 1923 or early 1924, there was a train wreck on the branch line, following which Paul was fired from his roadmaster job.
He began work as a brakeman for MoPac. On Sunday, Nov. 2, 1924 he wrote a letter of condolence to a woman in Glenmora, La. whose son, a
railroad man, had been killed in a railroad accident a few days earlier; Paul had been present when the man died. On Monday, Nov. 3, he
worked as brakeman on a freight train from El Dorado down to Monroe, La.; the train was tied up and he was off duty when he hopped on side
of a box car hooked to a switch engine to ride from the freight yard on the south side of Monroe up to the MoPac passenger depot, intending
to go to the Busy Bee Hotel, across the street from the depot. As the box car passed the train shed at the depot, he was knocked off the
side of the box car and fell to the platform, sustaining skull fracture and brain injury; he died in St. Francis Hospital in Monroe at 2:36
a.m. on Friday, Nov. 7, 1924, never having regained consciousness after the fall.

<A HREF="r0001685.htm#f32">32</A>.  <A NAME="f32b"></A>Lottie receive little formal education--about 8th grade equivalent. She married her
cousin, Paul, at Vicksburg, Mississippi April 30, 1911 and gave birth to her first child, Agnes, shortly after her nineteenth birthday;
thereafter, she bore four sons, the first of whom was stillborn in 1915. Widowed four days before her 32nd birthday, with four children
ranging in age from 12 down to 3, she moved the family back to the house near Ball, La. on the Grant/Rapides parish line, which she and Paul
had built about 1916-1917. When her youngest son, Tim, began school in the fall of 1926, she enrolled in Vincent's Business College in
Alexandria and learned stenography and bookkeeping, following which she worked for several Alexandria businesses until the summer of 1930.
After the stock market crash of 1929, jobs became scarce; nearly all business enterprises reduced their work force and such a reduction
ended Lottie's last office job. She hired her father's first cousin, Johnston ROBERTSON, to construct a building on her land on Hwy. 165
just about the Grant/Rapides parish line, using the small amout of capital she had left following sale of home she and Paul had owned in El
Dorado, Arkansas, and began in the retail grocery business in November, 1930. The depression was growing worse, and money became more and
more scarce; it appeared she could not keep the store going, but she sank into it the only capital she had left, $100 in savings, about late
1931. The very bottom of the Depression was probably 1933-33, but she managed to keep the business going and it prospered more as
Roosevelt's &quot;New Deal&quot; began to pump a little more money into the nation's economy. About 1940-41, when Camp Livingston was built and
manned, the business &quot;Boomed&quot; to some extent, and did well until Lottie retired and sold the business in about 1959. Hard-working,
courageous and thrifty, Lottie was by nature cheerful and and was happy much of her life, although suffering many griefs. None of her
children ever suffered hunger or the fear of hunger in spite of difficulties. She had chances, but so far as known never even seriously
considered re-marriage. She suffered much from arthritis for years; had major surgery about 1960, but was ill only a short time before death
from congestive heart failure May 23, 1977.
September 1926 Lottie started Business course and then worked for Posner and Laird, wholesalers; Pace and Henry Transfer Company; Pineville
Gas. She owned and operated a General Mercantile and Grocery Store (1930-1959). After retirement she, with a cousin, Aline Duke, ran a gift
shop in the building which had been the grocery store. Her home and store were located on Hwy. 165 just on the edge of Grant Parish near
Kitchen Creek Church.

(Mrs. David A. HILLS). The total at this time was 67 acres, with 34 acres located in Rapides Parish and 33 acres in Grant Parish. One acre
had been sold to a Will Adkins, a northeast corner; 12 acres was purchased by the railroad for a right-of-way. The original purchase was
Iron Mountain Railroad (later MoPac) by Jay Gould (1978 [1878? -- WBS]). The 67 acre tract was purchased for $2500. (In 1978 one acre could
bring that amount.) In the 1970s Elliot Wilson ROBERTSON purchased from Wilson the said property.

<A HREF="r0001686.htm#f62">62</A>.  <A NAME="f62b"></A>&quot;On June 30, 1887, George Lee Robertson, a native of Covington County, Mississippi,
was united in marriage with Mary Missouri Morgan, of Rapides Parish, Louisiana. The ceremony was performed by Reverend J.P. Patton at the
home of A.J. Willbanks. He was the eldest son of George Granberry and Amanda Chambers Robertson, originally from Mississippi and who had
subsequently moved to Louisiana. She was the daughter of John and Marcia Chambers. Witnessing the marriage at the Willbanks home were Mr.
and Mrs. A.J. Willbanks and S.D. Willbanks. &quot;From this union 15 children were born, eight daughters and seven sons. All children, as far as
can be determined, were born at Nugent, in Grant Parish, Rt. 2 Pollock, Louisiana. The family home where they grew up was situated on the
Grant and Rapides Parish line, which led to the oft-repeated statement by the growing boys [heard more than once by this grandson of D.L.
ROBERTSON -- WBS] that they &quot;ate in Rapides and slept in Grant.&quot; [Note: this home is still standing and can be seen from La. Hwy. 165
which runs between Alexandria and Monroe, La. -- WBS, 02/11/1994] &quot;The family grew up on a small farm on an 80 acre homestead divided by
the Iron Mountain Railroad, later renamed the Missouri Pacific (MoPac). Robertson Road extends on line of Rapides and Grant Parish. What
little extra money there was came from George's work in the commissary of the Nugent Lumber Co., at the mill or, later, from small amount he
was paid for Notary Public work. He also served as trustee of Ball School. &quot;As the older children grew up there was additional family
income from wages for work on the railroad and from school teaching. All adult girls and Ernest have taught public school in the earlier
years -- Rapides, Grant, Webster Parishes. &quot;A study of the family clearly shows that while the small farm was the basic provider for the
family, George was never really satisfied nor interested in farming as an occupation. Family records show numerous incidents which indicate
that his basic interest and abilities were in legal work or in writing. There seems to be little doubt that, had it been possible for him to
receive legal training before or while raising a family his life may have been happier and probably the family income would have been
greater. Ambition and interest was above average in education. &quot;On the other hand there are many samples of his writing showing and unusual
'knack' for word usage. Further, family records bear out that he loved to write. There are poems and other writings, all of which indicate
that he must have had a 'flair' for writing. Records indicate also that this writing ability was recognized by relatives and friends, many
of whom called on him to write obituaries for deceased relatives and friends. &quot;Later, when the small farm eroded because of the little
known or practiced soil conservation, and with top soil gone, could no longer support the family, the income of the older children helped
with family expenses, medical bills and education expense for the younger children. In later life George, with financial support of a son,
Ernest, tried his hand, unsuccessfully, at operating a restaurant and later operating a grocery store. Both were located at Paradise, a
small community on Highway 165 between Alexandria and Pollock named by George L. Robertson. For this occupation, while he was very
interested, he was not ideally suited by temperament, health and training. Further, his faith in his fellow man and desire to help the
unfortunate led to many losses that he never recovered. Illness finally forced him to give up operation of the store. &quot;By the time some of
the younger children arrived, the older members were getting married and having children of their own. &quot;As for the mother of the family,
Mary, her life seemed to have been one of perpetual activity. Her family leadership in many activities especially in religious training and
education of the family seems very evident. It was around her that the family rallied in time of trouble, and it was to her that many of the
family looked for leadership. What with having 15 children, cooking for a growing family, washing, housekeeping, milking the cows, doing the
gardening to feed the family and still helping in the field, her life was never quiet or dull. And yet there always was time for active
church participation.&quot;

which a board bill for the George Granberry Family is listed. This notebook indicates that prior to the founding of Kitchen Creek Church the
G. G. ROBERTSON family attended church at Clear Creek Church, in the Clear Creek Community northeast of the Camp Livingston area.
Clear Creek Methodist Church was established 1885, rebuilt 1962. According to the June 1, 1880 Census, the George Granberry ROBERTSON family
resided in Franklin Parish, Louisiana.
&quot;George Granberry Robertson, born at Covington County, MS, July 16, 1837, died in Louisiana February 15, 1902 and married March 5, 1862 in
Mississippi to Amanda Mortimer Chambers. Amanda was born April 16, 1844; died February 5, 1906. Both are buried in Kitchen Creek Cemetary,
Rt. 2, Pollock, Louisiana near the Grant, Rapides Parish line.
&quot;Soon after his marriage he enlisted in the Confederate Army and served until the war ended. The last eight months he was a prisoner of war
at Camp Chase, Ohio. On August 12, 1863, while home on parole he and his wife were baptized into Leaf River Church. (Pastor: W.E. Shepard.)
He engaged in farming after the war and in 1880 he and his family moved to Louisiana. An elder brother, Norvell Loammi, had preceded him.
&quot;Retiring in his nature, he sought no public places, choosing rather to serve the Lord he loved. On [August] 12, 1863, he, his wife, a
younger brother and a sister were baptized into the Baptist Old Leaf River Church near Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
&quot;He came from a religious family, and was a grandson and a nephew of TWO Norvell Robertsons, Norvell Sr., and Norvell, Jr., who for many
years were so prominent in the Baptist Ministry of South-east Mississippi. His brother, Norvell Loammi, was pastor for a number of years at
Kitchens Creek Baptist Church and he served as assistant pastor and was one of the Founders of the Church.&quot;

<A HREF="r0001683.htm#f73">73</A>.  <A NAME="f73b"></A>&quot;Ransom Wyatt ROBERTSON moved with his parents from Mississippi to Grant Parish,
Louisiana 1880-81. He received little formal education, possibly 5th grade or equivalent, probably mostly or altogether in Mississippi.
Throughout his life, however, he did much reading and educated himself to a much higher level. Before his marriage to Amanda Delilah EMMONS
on April 26, 1890, and for some years thereafter, he worked in sawmills. Beginning about 1900 or a little later, he began to support his
growing family by truck farming and ceased sawmill work. For part of those early years, he worked as far from hom as Urania, Louisiana
(LaSalle Parish), paying board there and coming home to see his family only from Saturday night to Sunday night; Saturdays were full
work-days in those times, and he received the same $1.25 for 10 hours of work on Saturdays as on other days of the week. As a young man,
under the tutelage of his father, George Granberry ROBERTSON, and his uncle, Norvell Loammi ROBERTSON, who was a preacher, he became active
in Kitchen's Creek Baptist Church and was a deacon and principal director of church affairs for many years. He led a very industrious and
active life until his health failed in his late 60s; I think he was generally happy, although happiness was repeatedly marred by tragedy in
losses by death of children, grandchildren and others. While he was never wealthy, he was a successful farmer for many years; through his
industry and thrift and that of his wife, his family was well provided for. I am sure none of his children ever experienced real hunger, or
fear of hunger.&quot;
<BR>
<A HREF="r0001683.htm#f74">74</A>.  <A NAME="f74b"></A>&quot;Both of Delilah's (Lilah) parents, first names unknown, died within a short space
of time when she was a small child; she and her older brother Roland were reared in the home of their maternal grandmother, Crump, somewhere
on Clear Creek, Grant Parish. I believe Grandma Crump was already a widow when the Emmons children began to live in home; I believe her
maiden name wasLowe and the sons named Frank, John, Billy, Alex, possibly others; there were daughters also. In childhood, Delilah suffered
an illness--possible scarlet fever--which affected her hearing; she was partially deaf most of her life and wore a hearing aid for many
years. Delilah received very little formal education, possibly about the equivalent of 3rd grade, but was highly intelligent, also extremely
industrious and thrifty. By nature she was cheerful, and I believe her life was generally happy, in spite of much tragedy and hardship,
until about 1940. Her husband died in 1942; she had suffered many bereavements before that time, losing several children and grandchildren,
and suffered others thereafter; her health was not good and she was unable to remain active in her later years.&quot;

sugar cane and peanuts. He had a sugar cane mill known as a syrup mill because of the producing of syrup. The children helped before and
after school and were allowed to have a horse although the girls were not allowed to ride, for it was considered &quot;unladylike.&quot; Once when
Esther allowed a friend to cut her hair short she received a &quot;whipping&quot; from her parent. Johnny and Ola's children attended the local
schools, namely Ball Grammar, Simms, Pollock and Tioga. John H. ROBERTSON was a member of Ball Baptist Church. His grave marker at

not constant. He took part in the seige of Vicksburg and in the battle of Nashville. He commenced serving as a delagate to the Ebenezer
Association in 1865 or 1866 and served continuously until 1878 and was constantly clerk for eleven or twelve years. In 1877 he was licensed
to preach by Leaf River Church under the pastoral care of the venerable James P. Johnston, and in the following year was ordained to the
full work of the ministry by Revs. Johnston and R.L. King, but only took charge of the Williamsburg church in the following winter, and
removed himself to Grant Parish, Louisiana, in April, 1879. There he found himself in a hotbed of Arminians and being a Calvinistic Baptist
he had great opposition and reproach to meet, which seemed to cripple his usefulness a great deal, but the Lord knows. In May, 1891, his
wife died; and one year later he left La. and returned to his old neighborhood, and in January following he accepted the care of Prospect
and Oral churches in the Pearl Leaf Association, which churches he still has on his hands. He says that his life has not been morally,
religiously, intellectually, or financially such as he could wish and that he has never attained to that state of Christian perfection
claimed by so many in these days, nor is he yet able to dispense with faith and walk by sight as some of his brethren seem to do.&quot; -- W.P.

Virginia. He was born May 22, 1765 in Buckingham County in that state and raised in Cumberland County.&quot; From writings of Alice Tracy WELCH

Norvell ROBERTSON, Sr. was enlisted in July 1781 in the Virginia State Militia, serving at Yorktown in building the breastworks to protect
the army from the British. He was discharged at Yorktown on the day of Lord Cornwallis's surrender of the British army. He migrated to
Georgia, later to Mississippi (1818) where he first settled on the west side of Leaf River at the junction of Bowie. Here he lived for 15
years before he moved to about 15 miles north of Old Williamsburg, where he died. He was buried in the Leaf River Baptist Cemetary on

Library, Department of Archives and History, Jackson, MS., the following paragraph was written: &quot;Norvell Robertson, Sr. was probably of
Scotch Ancestry and descended from one of five brothers who came from Great Britain and landed at Jamestown in the early settling of
Virginia. He was born May 22, 1765 in Buckingham County in that state and raised in Cumberland County.&quot; From writings of Alice Tracy WELCH
of Laurel, MS: &quot;I learned from a deaf and dumb (mute) member of the Virginia Robertsons in 1886 that all Virginia Robertsons sprang from
five brothers who landed in Jamestown about the first settling of the place.&quot;
Norvell ROBERTSON, Sr. was enlisted in July 1781 in the Virginia State Militia, serving at Yorktown in building the breastworks to protect
the army from the British. He was discharged at Yorktown on the day of Lord Cornwallis's surrender of the British army. He migrated to
Georgia, later to Mississippi (1818) where he first settled on the west side of Leaf River at the junction of Bowie. Here he lived for 15
years before he moved to about 15 miles north of Old Williamsburg, where he died. He was buried in the Leaf River Baptist Cemetary on
September 16, 1855.
