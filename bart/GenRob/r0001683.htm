born in Covington County, Mississippi 16 JUL 1837.  George died 15 FEB 1902 in Louisiana, at 64 years of age.  His body
was interred in Kitchen Creek Cemetary, Pollock, Louisiana.
<P>
<A NAME="i1684"></A>He married Amanda Mortimer CHAMBERS 5 MAR 1862.  Amanda was born 16 APR 1844.  Amanda was the daughter
of John CHAMBERS and Marcia WELCH.  Amanda died 5 FEB 1906 at 61 years of age.  Her body was interred in Kitchens
Creek Cemetary, Pollock, Louisiana.  SOURCE NOTES: This information comes from writing by George Lee ROBERTSON, eldest son of George
Granberry ROBERTSON. On September 20, 1880 George Lee ROBERTSON purchased a notebook in Pineville, La. in which a board bill for the George
Granberry Family is listed.  This notebook indicates that prior to the founding of Kitchen Creek Church the G. G. ROBERTSON family attended
church at Clear Creek Church, in the Clear Creek Community northeast of the Camp Livingston area. <P> Clear Creek Methodist Church
was established 1885, rebuilt 1962.  According to the June 1, 1880 Census, the George Granberry ROBERTSON family resided in Franklin Parish,
Louisiana. <P> &quot;George Granberry Robertson, born at Covington County, MS, July 16, 1837, died in Louisiana February 15, 1902 and
married March 5, 1862 in Mississippi to Amanda Mortimer Chambers.  Amanda was born April 16, 1844; died February 5, 1906.  Both are buried
in Kitchen Creek Cemetary, Rt. 2, Pollock, Louisiana near the Grant, Rapides Parish line. <P> &quot;Soon after his marriage he enlisted
in the Confederate Army and served until the war ended.  The last eight months he was a prisoner of war at Camp Chase, Ohio.  On August 12,
1863, while home on parole he and his wife were baptized into Leaf River Church.  (Pastor: W.E. Shepard.)  He engaged in farming after the
war and in 1880 he and his family moved to Louisiana.  An elder brother, Norvell Loammi, had preceded him. <P> &quot;Retiring in his
nature, he sought no public places, choosing rather to serve the Lord he loved.  On [August] 12, 1863, he, his wife, a younger brother and a
sister were baptized into the Baptist Old Leaf River Church near Hattiesburg, Mississippi. <P> &quot;He came from a religious family,
and was a grandson and a nephew of TWO Norvell Robertsons, Norvell Sr., and Norvell, Jr., who for many years were so prominent in the
Baptist Ministry of South-east Mississippi.  His brother, Norvell Loammi, was pastor for a number of years at Kitchens Creek Baptist Church
and he served as assistant pastor and was one of the Founders of the Church.&quot;

<A NAME="i2041"></A>Ransom Wyatt ROBERTSON<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP><A NAME="f73"></A><A HREF="gsourcer.htm#f73b">(73)</A></SUP></FONT> was born in
Covington County, Mississippi 24 JUN 1869.  Ransom died 12 JAN 1942 in At his home in Grant Parish, at 72 years of age.
His body was interred in Kitchen Creek Cemetary, Pollock, Louisiana.  <A NAME="i2042"></A>He married Amanda Delilah EMMONS
26 APR 1890.  Amanda was born in near Flat Creek, Winn Parish, Louisiana 20 FEB 1869.  Amanda<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP><A NAME="f74"></A><A
HREF="gsourcer.htm#f74b">(74)</A></SUP></FONT> was the daughter of unknown EMMONS and unknown CRUMP.  Amanda died 25 MAY
1958 in At her home, at 89 years of age.  Her body was interred in Kitchen Creek Cemetary, Pollock, Louisiana.  SOURCE NOTES:
Information concerning Ransom Wyatt ROBERTSON was written by his grandson, Lee Wyatt ROBERTSON. &quot;Ransom Wyatt ROBERTSON moved with his
parents from Mississippi to Grant Parish, Louisiana 1880-81.  He received little formal education, possibly 5th grade or equivalent,
probably mostly or altogether in Mississippi. Throughout his life, however, he did much reading and educated himself to a much higher level.
Before his marriage to Amanda Delilah EMMONS on April 26, 1890, and for some years thereafter, he worked in sawmills.  Beginning about 1900
or a little later, he began to support his growing family by truck farming and ceased sawmill work.  For part of those early years, he
worked as far from hom as Urania, Louisiana (LaSalle Parish), paying board there and coming home to see his family only from Saturday night
to Sunday night; Saturdays were full work-days in those times, and he received the same $1.25 for 10 hours of work on Saturdays as on other
days of the week.  As a young man, under the tutelage of his father, George Granberry ROBERTSON, and his uncle, Norvell Loammi ROBERTSON,
who was a preacher, he became active in Kitchen's Creek Baptist Church and was a deacon and principal director of church affairs for many
years. He led a very industrious and active life until his health failed in his late 60s; I think he was generally happy, although happiness
was repeatedly marred by tragedy in losses by death of children, grandchildren and others.  While he was never wealthy, he was a successful
farmer for many years; through his industry and thrift and that of his wife, his family was well provided for.  I am sure none of his
children ever experienced real hunger, or fear of hunger.&quot;

born in Mississippi 16 DEC 1873.  John died 13 SEP 1960 in Louisiana, at 86 years of age.  His body was interred in
Springhill Cemetary.  <A NAME="i2290"></A>He married Viola Rosela (Ola) ATES 12 SEP 1900.  Viola was born 24 APR 1884.
Viola<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP><A NAME="f77"></A><A HREF="gsourcer.htm#f77b">(77)</A></SUP></FONT> was the daughter of William B. ATES and
Laura A..  Viola died 3 APR 1967 at 82 years of age.  Her body was interred in Springhill Cemetary.  Following his
marriage to Ola, Johnny worked at Ball Sawmill and they lived on Ball's front.  About a year later they moved to the old homeplace on
Springhill Road and he started truck farming.  The main crops were strawberries, sugar cane and peanuts.  He had a sugar cane mill known as
a syrup mill because of the producing of syrup.  The children helped before and after school and were allowed to have a horse although the
girls were not allowed to ride, for it was considered &quot;unladylike.&quot;  Once when Esther allowed a friend to cut her hair short she received
a &quot;whipping&quot; from her parent. Johnny and Ola's children attended the local schools, namely Ball Grammar, Simms, Pollock and Tioga.  John
H. ROBERTSON was a member of Ball Baptist Church.  His grave marker at Springhill Cemetary reads &quot;The Lord is my Rock and Salvation.&quot;

Wilson and Mae ROBERTSON and Peggy Sandifer visited the Clear Creek Methodist Church Cemetary in search of Joseph Walter's grave but to date
[1979 --WBS] have found no evidence of where he was buried.&quot;
