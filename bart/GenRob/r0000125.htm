Jackson, Mississippi  39205. Reference: Auditor's Report, Virginia State Library, Richmond, Virginia. From microfilm in Covington County,
MS. under Religion and Church in the State Library, Department of Archives and History, Jackson, MS., the following paragraph was written:
&quot;Norvell Robertson, Sr. was probably of Scotch Ancestry and descended from one of five brothers who came from Great Britain and landed at
Jamestown in the early settling of Virginia.  He was born May 22, 1765 in Buckingham County in that state and raised in Cumberland County.&quot;
From writings of Alice Tracy WELCH of Laurel, MS: &quot;I learned from a deaf and dumb (mute) member of the Virginia Robertsons in 1886 that all
Virginia Robertsons sprang from five brothers who landed in Jamestown about the first settling of the place.&quot; <P> Norvell
ROBERTSON, Sr. was enlisted in July 1781 in the Virginia State Militia, serving at Yorktown in building the breastworks to protect the army
from the British.  He was discharged at Yorktown on the day of Lord Cornwallis's surrender of the British army.  He migrated to Georgia,
later to Mississippi (1818) where he first settled on the west side of Leaf River at the junction of Bowie.  Here he lived for 15 years
before he moved to about 15 miles north of Old Williamsburg, where he died.  He was buried in the Leaf River Baptist Cemetary on September
16, 1855.
