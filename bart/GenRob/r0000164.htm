Maude May ROBERTSON (dau. of Wheeler Erastus ROBERTSON, son of Norvell Loammi ROBERTSON) compiled the descendants of Norvell Loammi
ROBERTSON. &quot;In 1862 he entered the Confederate Army, but owing to bad health his service was not constant.  He took part in the seige of
Vicksburg and in the battle of Nashville.  He commenced serving as a delagate to the Ebenezer Association in 1865 or 1866 and served
continuously until 1878 and was constantly clerk for eleven or twelve years.  In 1877 he was licensed to preach by Leaf River Church under
the pastoral care of the venerable James P. Johnston, and in the following year was ordained to the full work of the ministry by Revs.
Johnston and R.L. King, but only took charge of the Williamsburg church in the following winter, and removed himself to Grant Parish,
Louisiana, in April, 1879. There he found himself in a hotbed of Arminians and being a Calvinistic Baptist he had great opposition and
reproach to meet, which seemed to cripple his usefulness a great deal, but the Lord knows.  In May, 1891, his wife died; and one year later
he left La. and returned to his old neighborhood, and in January following he accepted the care of Prospect and Oral churches in the Pearl
Leaf Association, which churches he still has on his hands.  He says that his life has not been morally, religiously, intellectually, or
financially such as he could wish and that he has never attained to that state of Christian perfection claimed by so many in these days, nor
is he yet able to dispense with faith and walk by sight as some of his brethren seem to do.&quot; -- W.P. (William Pitt) Chambers, Hattiesburg,
Mississippi.
