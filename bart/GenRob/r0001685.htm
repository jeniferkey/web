Kitchen Creek Cemetary, Pollock, Louisiana.  SOURCE NOTES: The following essay was written by Donald L. ROBERTSON, George Lee ROBERTSON's
youngest child, in 1978. &quot;On June 30, 1887, George Lee Robertson, a native of Covington County, Mississippi, was united in marriage with
Mary Missouri Morgan, of Rapides Parish, Louisiana.  The ceremony was performed by Reverend J.P. Patton at the home of A.J. Willbanks.  He
was the eldest son of George Granberry and Amanda Chambers Robertson, originally from Mississippi and who had subsequently moved to
Louisiana.  She was the daughter of John and Marcia Chambers.  Witnessing the marriage at the Willbanks home were Mr. and Mrs. A.J.
Willbanks and S.D. Willbanks. &quot;From this union 15 children were born, eight daughters and seven sons. All children, as far as can be
determined, were born at Nugent, in Grant Parish, Rt. 2 Pollock, Louisiana.  The family home where they grew up was situated on the Grant
and Rapides Parish line, which led to the oft-repeated statement by the growing boys [heard more than once by this grandson of D.L.
ROBERTSON -- WBS] that they &quot;ate in Rapides and slept in Grant.&quot;  [Note: this home is still standing and can be seen from La. Hwy. 165
which runs between Alexandria and Monroe, La. -- WBS, 02/11/1994] &quot;The family grew up on a small farm on an 80 acre homestead divided by
the Iron Mountain Railroad, later renamed the Missouri Pacific (MoPac). Robertson Road extends on line of Rapides and Grant Parish.  What
little extra money there was came from George's work in the commissary of the Nugent Lumber Co., at the mill or, later, from small amount he
was paid for Notary Public work. He also served as trustee of Ball School. &quot;As the older children grew up there was additional family
income from wages for work on the railroad and from school teaching.  All adult girls and Ernest have taught public school in the earlier
years -- Rapides, Grant, Webster Parishes. &quot;A study of the family clearly shows that while the small farm was the basic provider for the
family, George was never really satisfied nor interested in farming as an occupation.  Family records show numerous incidents which indicate
that his basic interest and abilities were in legal work or in writing.  There seems to be little doubt that, had it been possible for him
to receive legal training before or while raising a family his life may have been happier and probably the family income would have been
greater.  Ambition and interest was above average in education. &quot;On the other hand there are many samples of his writing showing and
unusual 'knack' for word usage.  Further, family records bear out that he loved to write.  There are poems and other writings, all of which
indicate that he must have had a 'flair' for writing. Records indicate also that this writing ability was recognized by relatives and
friends, many of whom called on him to write obituaries for deceased relatives and friends. &quot;Later, when the small farm eroded because of
the little known or practiced soil conservation, and with top soil gone, could no longer support the family, the income of the older
children helped with family expenses, medical bills and education expense for the younger children.  In later life George, with financial
support of a son, Ernest, tried his hand, unsuccessfully, at operating a restaurant and later operating a grocery store.  Both were located
at Paradise, a small community on Highway 165 between Alexandria and Pollock named by George L. Robertson.  For this occupation, while he
was very interested, he was not ideally suited by temperament, health and training. Further, his faith in his fellow man and desire to help
the unfortunate led to many losses that he never recovered.  Illness finally forced him to give up operation of the store. &quot;By the time
some of the younger children arrived, the older members were getting married and having children of their own. &quot;As for the mother of the
family, Mary, her life seemed to have been one of perpetual activity.  Her family leadership in many activities especially in religious
training and education of the family seems very evident.  It was around her that the family rallied in time of trouble, and it was to her
that many of the family looked for leadership. What with having 15 children, cooking for a growing family, washing, housekeeping, milking
the cows, doing the gardening to feed the family and still helping in the field, her life was never quiet or dull.  And yet there always was
time for active church participation.&quot;

Brown ROBERTSON, 1970. &quot;Aberdeen Paul Robertson, beloved and adored son of George L. and Mary M. Robertson, and the faithful and devoted
husband of Lottie R. Robertson, died in St. Francis Sanitarium, Monroe, Louisiana, on Friday morning, November 7, 1924, at 2:36 o'clock.
His death resulted from an accident which occurred on Monday November 3, about 5:30 p.m. in the yards of the Missouri Pacific Railway
Company, at Monroe, in which, while holding to the ladder of a moving car, his left arm struck the rafters of the shed in the yards,
knocking him asunder from the car, and he fell, striking his head upon the brick pavement, receiving a severe bruise and laceration on the
right side of the upper cranium.  He was conveyed to the sanitarium where he received attention of physicians and the attendance of
efficient nurses. &quot;Although unconscious from the moment struck, his appearance otherwise was that of unbroken normality, and for three days
sanguine hopes of his recovery were fostered by his loved ones and friends who visited his bedside.  But later investigation revealed a
fracture in the skull and hemorrhage in the posterior and base of the brain, and withing a few hours following the operation of removing
blood-clots there-from, an ominously unfavorable change of symptoms developed, and in the early hours of this fatal morning, his soul passed
to 'THE GREAT BEYOND,' stemmed the 'VALLEY and SHADOWS of DEATH,' and traversed the cold stream of 'JORDAN,' and entered into that 'HEAVEN
of REST' prepared for 'THE REDEEMED.' &quot;Thus ends a human career comprising the space of thirty-four years, two months and one day, which is
truly illustrious and exemplary that his youth and adolescence encountered environment insuperable and the emediments of narrowly limited
opportunities. &quot;At the time of this most tragical and untimely event, which not only precipitated his loved ones into heart-rending
anguish, but also casts a pall of sorrow over the whole community, he was residing in Eldorado, Arkansas, and was in the employ of Missouri
Pacific Railway Company, in which vocation he had continuously remained from his earliest adult days, having achieved marked success and
efficiency, performing the function of roadmaster for almost four years. &quot;Paul was born September 6, 1890, at northern boundary of Rapides
Parish, ten miles north of Alexandria, Louisiana, and here nurtured and reared to adult age and stature by fond and devoting parents, whose
comfort and welfare were the prime object of his deepest solicitude at all times.  He received his Christian double name in honor of the
late ABERDEEN WILSON STEWART of Pollock, Louisiana, and his great-grandfather, the late ASAPH PAUL ROBERTSON [actually Asaph POWELL
Robertson -- WBS] of COVINGTON COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI, respectively. Quite early in life he trusted JESUS CHRIST and was baptized into the
membership of Sardis Missionary Baptist Church, subsequently transferring by letter to KITCHEN CREEK CHURCH of the same faith. &quot;On April
30, 1911 he wedded Miss Lottie Robertson, whose character, personality and life record is a living monument of honor to the highest
standards of feminine rectitude, virtue and refinement. &quot;His remains arrived over the Missouri Pacific at the home of his childhood on
Friday night at 8:45 o'clock, lying in state until Sunday at 11 A.M. and, during this interval, countless tokens of love and condolence came
to the solemn chamber of the dead and were laid at the shrine.  As we viewed his lifeless features for the last time, on which rested no
shadow of an unhallowed thought, but, instead, the indelible imprint of perfect love and trust in Him who doeth all things well, good will
to man, absolute resignation to the immutable decrees of nature in sublime sacred halo, we thought it the sweetest visage we ever looked
upon. &quot;He leaves his beloved wife and four children, namely, Agnes, Lee, Bruce and Norvell, respectively; also on senior and five junior
brothers, namely, Grover, Ernest, Wilson, Idolia, Wilmer and Donald, respectively, and six sisters, namely, Mrs. Gertrude Gunter, of Dallas,
Texas, Mrs. Amanda Roy, of Cedar Grove, Louisiana and Misses Ethel, Zetta, Vivian and Geneva Robertson, respectively. &quot;The funeral
solemnities were conducted by his life-long and beloved pastor, who, in the presence of a vast assembly of sorrowing friends and kindred,
delivered a most appropriate and impressive discourse, after which members of Curtis T. Hines Lodge No. 317, F. &amp A. M., of which order the
deceased was an honored and esteemed member, in a body took charge of the obsequies.  Six of their number acting as pall-bearers, bore the
remains to the grave and performed the funeral rites of the order, during which ceremony a number of the members of the Alexandria Klan No.
12 of the K.K.K., marched in file to the grave and performing their ceremonial tributes to the dead, kneeled around the grave and uttered a
fervent prayer, then arose and in file departed, and the Masonic brethren proceeded to make interment, at the conclusion of which the
benediction was pronounced by Elder J. H. Coulson, which and a magnificent and luxurious decoration of floral tokens of love offerings were
lavishly placed on the silent mound so covered, it entirely concealed the mound. &quot;                         ONE WHO LOVED HIM &quot;
HIS FATHER      GEORGE LEE ROBERTSON&quot; <P> [from Lee Wyatt ROBERTSON:]  Aberdeen Paul ROBERTSON was born near Nugent, La.  He
received little formal education--possibly 8th or 9th grade equivalent--and began working for the Missouri Pacific Railroad on section gang
as a youth.  While still in his teens, he became a section foreman, as did his elder brother, Grover.  Desiring to marry his first cousin,
he wrote to lawyers in various states in order to ascertain where such a marriage could be contracted; Louisiana law prohibited marriage of
first cousins. Mississippi had no such law, and he married his cousin, Lottie, at Vicksburg on April 30, 1911.  On January 15, 1912, they
produced the first grandchild, Agnes, on both sides of the family.  (Paul's elder brother, Grover, had married almost a year before Paul;
Lottie was the first to marry in her family.)  About 1920, Paul was promoted to roadmaster from section foreman, and was assigned to the
MoPac's branch line from Gurdon, Arkansas to Collington, La.; he moved his family from that house built about 1916-17 on Grant/Rapides
parish line to El Dorado, Arkansas, thence to Smackover, thence back to El Dorado.  About 1923 or early 1924, there was a train wreck on the
branch line, following which Paul was fired from his roadmaster job.  He began work as a brakeman for MoPac.  On Sunday, Nov. 2, 1924 he
wrote a letter of condolence to a woman in Glenmora, La. whose son, a railroad man, had been killed in a railroad accident a few days
earlier; Paul had been present when the man died.  On Monday, Nov. 3, he worked as brakeman on a freight train from El Dorado down to
Monroe, La.; the train was tied up and he was off duty when he hopped on side of a box car hooked to a switch engine to ride from the
freight yard on the south side of Monroe up to the MoPac passenger depot, intending to go to the Busy Bee Hotel, across the street from the
depot.  As the box car passed the train shed at the depot, he was knocked off the side of the box car and fell to the platform, sustaining
skull fracture and brain injury; he died in St. Francis Hospital in Monroe at 2:36 a.m. on Friday, Nov. 7, 1924, never having regained
consciousness after the fall.
