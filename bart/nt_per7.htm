<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<P>
I began studying personality typing in the late 1980s.  Where other
models claiming to explain human behavioral preferences were based on
such highly questionable notions as "planetary influences" or "ancient
wisdom" or birth dates, the Myers-Briggs theory was developed from
empirical data on how real people actually behave, rather than data
being collected to explain some plausible theory.  As a result, type
theory not only had a firm basis in reality, it had demonstrable
predictive value.
<P>
Still, it seemed somehow overly complicated.  Were there really sixteen
readily recognizable types of personalities?  Why sixteen?  Why not
seventeen, or seven, or thirty-two?  My understanding of personality
theory took a giant leap forward when I discovered a book by David
Keirsey and Marilyn Bates called <I>Please Understand Me</I>. While I've
never been wild about the title (which always sounds to me like
pathetic begging), this book contained the reduction to fundamentals
for which I'd been searching.  In distilling the sixteen types down to
four essential temperaments, Keirsey offered a sound model that
satisfactorily explained so many of my questions about character.
<P>
But as I studied the temperament model by testing it in the real world,
I began to suspect that there might be another level of structure,
a pattern by which the four temperaments were related to each other.  It
seemed to me that some people in this world have even greater difficulty
understanding each other's motives than could be due simply to having
different temperaments.  I wondered: could some temperaments be
especially unlike each other?  Could some temperaments be so unlike that
they actually oppose each other?  Keirsey's original model, published in
the 1970s, made no such distinction.  The four temperaments were treated
as four completely different things with no relation to each other; the
model contained no further structure.  What if a deeper level of
structure existed?  Was there any advantage to thinking of certain
temperaments as "opposites" of each other?
</P>

<BR>
<H3>BACKGROUND OF THE TWO DIMENSIONS</H3>

<P>
Much of my thinking on this was stimulated by having observed my own
behavior with my brothers, and (later) by studying politics. When I was
growing up I sometimes found it hard to understand people or to be
understood... but I definitely seemed to have more trouble with some
people than with others.  It was as though we weren't merely speaking
different languges; we seemed to be from different planets, totally
alien to one another.
<P>
It wasn't until I began exploring type and temperament theory that I
had a way to resolve these difficulties in understanding and being
understood.  The dynamics of my own family's behavior toward one another
suddenly made sense.  And yet the model seemed incomplete.  It didn't
explain the special difficulties I had, particularly with my middle
brother.  For many years it seemed that he looked down on my style of
dealing with the world, and I had a similar lack of respect for what I
considered his incomprehensible motivations and attitudes.  Despite
years of growing up with the same parents, we seemed to have absolutely
nothing in common in terms of goals or motivations, and in fact could
not even fathom living each other's lives.  This always puzzled
me.  That we were different, I understood... but why <EM>so</EM>
different?
<P>
In a roundabout way, politics was the key that unlocked the answer to
this mystery.  To put it briefly, temperament defines personal goals;
power is the means by which goals are achieved; and politics is the
expression of power.  Therefore, how people in general behave
politically should tell us something about temperament.
<P>
Although there certainly are exceptions, years of observation strongly
suggest to me that each temperament can be linked with a particular
political idealogy.  The Guardian concern for social structure sounds
very much like conservatism.  The Idealist focus on personal identity
appears to be the driving force behind modern liberalism.  And the
Rational insistence on personal autonomy, based on an abiding faith in
the power of reason to solve all problems, is at the heart of the
libertarian philosophy.
<P>
The Artisans, however, are a bit different.  While a few may aspire to
complete control by the state over individuals (the essence of fascism),
most Artisans are simply too busy enjoying life's sensations to hold any
one political idealogy.  Instead, those who are active politically will
simply pick and choose idealogies as it suits them--whatever seems at
the moment to offer the most freedom to experience the world.  The rest,
unwilling to be tied down to any idealogy, are likely to be most of
those who today identify themselves as "moderates."  The Artisan,
demanding complete freedom, seems to me to be most likely to state that
he or she is "fiscally conservative but socially liberal."  In other
words, anyone who tries to prevent an Artisan from enjoying the
pleasures of life had better get ready for a fight.
<P>
So what does all this have to do with finally figuring out why my
brother and I had so much trouble understanding each other, and how does
it relate to my model of temperamental opposites?  The answer lies in
realizing how distinctly different the various political factions are;
different, that is, in what they think are the "right" goals.  Modern
liberals clearly reject conservative philosophy as heartless, while
conservatives equally reject liberalism as feel-goodism.  And although
it's not as visible, anyone hearing the scorn expressed by Jeffersonian
libertarians for the mindless use of power (or for not using power at
all), or the moderate's dismissal of ineffective theorizing by "ivory
tower" elites, must suspect a similar special quality of misunderstanding
between these philosophical pairs.
<P>
If innate temperament usually lies at the heart of political differences
(as I suspect that it does), then isn't it reasonable to suggest that,
just as there are opposing political forces, there may be "opposite"
temperaments?  If some temperaments truly are radically unlike each
other, wouldn't that explain why my brother and I had so much trouble
appreciating each other's world-views?
<P>
And if so, then what's the fundamental basis for certain temperaments
being so unlike each other?  <EM>How</EM> are they different?
</P>

<BR>
<H3>KEIRSEY'S MODEL</H3>

<P>
As Keirsey perceptively observed, the most important attribute that
distinguishes the temperaments from one another is what Keirsey called
the style of communication.  In his terms, a person tends to prefer
either a "concrete" style or an "abstract" style.  In Jungian terms,
these correspond to the Sensing (S) and iNtuitive preferences,
respectively.
<P>
I agree with Keirsey on this.  The S/N choice appears, by all the
evidence, to be the most fundamental expression of personality.  But I
prefer to describe this preference with words that have a slightly
different emphasis.  I would say that the personality characteristic
that most distinguishes individuals from one another is where they look
for information about what's important, or, to put it another way,
what's right and wrong.  (Note that getting information requires
communication.)
<P>
For many persons, "truth" is found in the external world (the Sensing
"S" preference).  For others, knowledge of what is right and good lies
within, in "the inner voice" (the iNtuitive "N" preference).  In other
words, some people are concerned with externals, such as form,
attributes, information, and the opinions of other people.  (Note how
closely these terms are related to Keirsey's "concrete"
communication.)  Other people, meanwhile, focus on internals, such as
function, essence, belief, and their own impulses.
<P>
So, despite slight differences in emphasis, Keirsey and I agree that
this S/N split is the first factor in distinguishing the temperaments
from one another.  But there are four temperaments!  One division gives
us only two possible temperaments, so there must be at least one other
important difference in people to allow for four different
temperaments.  The nature of this second factor is where Keirsey and I
part ways.
<P>
According to Keirsey (in the 1990s updating of his ideas, <I>Please
Understand Me II</I>), the next most important distinguishing
personality characteristic reflects two opposing preferences in the use
of tools, which he calls "cooperative" and "utilitarian."  Although the
problem may lie in the words used to express this "tool use" concept,
ultimately I found it unpersuasive as a secondary division.
<P>
Not only is it unclear how the "cooperative" and "utilitarian" concepts
are mutually exclusive (can't people cooperate to achieve some useful
end?), they don't appear to be expressions related to a single
one-dimensional concept.  "Where to look for truth" is a single concept
with two mutually exclusive expressions: "self" and "world."  But is
"tool use" really a similar kind of one-dimensional concept that can be
shared between two temperaments?  Or isn't tool use for manipulation of
the world primarily a feature of Artisans?
<P>
Furthermore, "self" and "world" relate very clearly to the Jungian and
Myers-Briggs type terms N and S, iNtuitive and Sensing.  To what
Myers-Briggs types do "cooperative" and "utilitarian" tool use relate?
<P>

<BR>
<H3>AN ALTERNATE DIMENSION</H3>

<P>
I propose a different secondary preference.  It seems to me that, after
where one looks for truth, the personality difference most important in
distinguishing between temperaments is one's level of comfort with the
unknown.
<P>
Comfort with the unknown is an attitude that manifests itself early in
life, and throughout a person's life it is a characteristic that rarely
changes and that can be readily determined.  It doesn't seem to be as
deterministic a character feature as the source of truth, but it's not
much less so.  This makes it a good theoretical candidate for the second
division that permits a two-dimensional view of temperament.  (As will
be demonstrated later, this theory is supported by practical evidence.)
<P>
Like the source of truth, comfort with the unknown can be expressed in
two mutually exclusive but related terms, like two sides of a coin.  As
where to look for truth can be understood as "self" versus "world," or
"internal" versus "external," comfort with the unknown can be expressed
as "stability" versus "change," or "structure" versus "motion."  For
some persons, stability, structure, pattern, order, and organization are
clearly to be preferred over their alternatives.  But others just as
clearly prefer those alternatives of motion, change, flux, freedom, and
choice.  These are, in fact, two mutually exclusive kinds of impulses
which form opposite poles along the one-dimensional axis of comfort with
the unknown.
<P>
Finally, these two opposing preferences can be accurately expressed in
terms of Myers-Briggs types.  Specifically, the impulse toward embracing
the unknown corresponds to the combined type of Feeling-Perceiving (FP),
and the preference for the known corresponds to the opposite combined
type of Thinking-Judging (TJ).
</P>

<BR>
<H3>MY MODEL</H3>

<P>
Thus we have two axes: one for the source of truth (N/S), and one for
comfort with the unknown (TJ/FP).  By combining these two dimensions we
produce a 2 x 2 matrix, and--as with Keirsey's model--in each one of the
four elements thus created we place the appropriate temperament.
<P>
Precisely where we start to place each temperament is unimportant; it is
only necessary that the four temperaments be correctly placed relative
to each other.  Thus, the combination of N with FP yields xNFP, for the
NF temperament.  (Interestingly, my original model placed both NF and NT
in the same locations as Keirsey did in his later published model.  I'll
retain that positioning.)  The combination of S with TJ yields xSTJ for
the SJ temperament so it goes into that corner.  Then we do likewise for
NT and SP.

<P>
The effect of using "comfort with the unknown" in place of "tool use" is
to swap the SJ and SP temperaments from Keirsey's diagram.  Instead of
(as Keirsey's model has it) NT and SJ being "opposite" temperaments, and
likewise for NF and SP, my model predicts that NT and SP temperaments
should seem the most different. Likewise, NF and SJ temperaments should
have the most difficultly understanding each other.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>THE EVIDENCE</H3>

<P>
Keirsey himself offers evidence that supports the "opposites" model I
present here.  <I>Please Understand Me II</I> contains a number of
comments suggesting meaningful differences between NFs and SJs, and
between NTs and SPs.
<P>
Below are a number of these remarks by Keirsey, divided by whether they
highlight Guardian/Idealist or Artisan/Rational differences.  In the
next section, I'll add my own reasons for considering each of these two
groups to be pairs of opposite temperaments.

<BR>
<H4>Guardians and Idealists</H4>

<P>
In discussing the differences between Guardian SJs and Idealist NFs,
Keirsey consistently highlights two particular kinds of differences:
one concerning outer morality versus inner morale, and one concerning
safety versus growth.  I think these distinctions can be described
equally well using my terminology of world-concern versus self-concern,
and the known versus the unknown.
<P>
As you read read Keirsey's contrasting descriptions below, consider
whether you think his "opposites" model of SJs as "concrete cooperators"
and NFs as "abstract cooperators" is more useful than my model, which
describes SJs as preferring a "structured world" and NFs as dedicated to
"changing self."  Watch for cluewords like "stable" and "social" to
describe SJs, and "passion" and "inner" to describe NFs.
</P>

<PRE>
(Idealists, it must be said, find little of personal value in learning
about commerce.)  Guardians, however, regard companies and corporations
as indispensable social institutions that allow them to earn their keep
and to provide for their families. (p. 87)
<P>
. . . both SJs and NFs are interested in helping or bettering others,
but while the NFs nurture good feelings, the SJs guard right and wrong.
(p. 87)
<P>
While self-esteem does not come easily to Guardians, they can develop a
healthy self-respect based on their beneficence, which means doing good
deeds.  (This is quite different from benevolence or good will, which is
an attitude displayed by Idealists.) (p. 94)
<P>
[NFs] want to do everything they can to keep people feeling good about
themselves, to lift their spirits, to brighten their mood, to boost
their morale.  Many Guardians have a similar interest in helping others,
but they are more preoccupied with morality, people's sense of right
and wrong, than with nurturing a positive self-image.  Both NFs and SJs
are guardians of the Good . . . but one cares for happiness and the
other for righteousness. (p. 130)
<P>
The Idealist notion of the grand passion is likely to mystify a
Guardian, who might enjoy the fantasy, but who wants to keep both feet
on the ground and go carefully about the business of courtship. (p. 224)
<P>
Guardians can be quite critical of Idealist enthusiasm, their propensity
to get carried away with an idea, which the SJ worries might break with
tradition and jeopardize a stable home.  And they can be badly
frustrated when asked by NFs to increase the depth and the meaning of
their relationship, with no clue on how to proceed, and with their
renewed efforts to stabilize and solidify the marriage only taken as a
sign of superficiality. (p. 227)
<P>
Like the Guardians, Idealists are concerned about having moral sanction
for their actions, but with a difference.  While Guardians tend to put
their trust in institutional authority (including church authority), and
thus care a great deal about licenses and wedding ceremonies, Idealists
are apt to follow their innermost feelings and personal religious
convictions, and thus will consider themselves married when they're sure
that deep bonding has taken place with their mates, and when private
words of devotion have been exchanged. (pp. 233-234)
<P>
The Guardian might listen dutifully to the Idealist's flights of
imagination, and might try to be more fanciful and passionate in order
to please the NF, but sooner or later the SJ feels unappreciated and
begin[s] to resist the force of the NF's Pygmalion Project--and the
result can be head-on battles. (p. 238)
</P>
</PRE>

<BR>
<H4>Artisans and Rationals</H4>

<P>
As with Guardians and Idealists, Keirsey focuses on two kinds of
differences between SP Artisans and NT Rationals: one concerning
external sensation versus internal comprehension, and one concerning
impulse versus control.  The distinctions that Keirsey draws between SPs
and NTs appear to correspond very well with the two differentiators of
my model, world-concern versus self-concern, and the unknown versus
the known.
<P>
As you read read Keirsey's contrasting descriptions below, consider
whether you think his "opposites" model of SPs as "concrete
utilitarians" and NFs as "abstract utilitarians" is better at explaining
the differences between Artisans and Rationals than my model, which
describes SPs as preferring a "changing world" and NTs as dedicated to
a "structured self."  Watch for cluewords like "free" and "performance"
to describe SPs, and "efficient" and "theory" to describe NTs.
</P>

<PRE>
. . . the Artisan is looking for maximum effect, the Rational for maximum
efficiency.  Artisans will spend whatever amount of effort is necessary
to get what they want; Rationals will not, since they require that the
most result is gotten with the least effort.  Getting results is more of
a theoretical issue with Rationals, a more practical issue with Artisans.
(p. 47)
<P>
In regard to this distinction between SP technique and NT technology,
it is necessary to understand that, although the two resemble each other
in a superficial manner, they are fundamentally different. . . . Technology
is the theoretical study of method, technique the empirical perfecting of
method. (p. 45)
<P>
It is a mistake to confuse the artistic action of the Artisans with the
efficient action of the Rationals. . . . The action that gets the most
result for the least effort is efficient, and NTs take pride in their
efficiency.  In contrast, graceful action boosts the SPs' self-esteem
regardless of the effort they put into the performance. . . . And in
this they can be quite wasteful of effort, at least in the eyes of the
NT. (p. 51)
<P>
. . . it is impossible for Rationals to play with the thoughtless
abandon of Artisans.  For the Artisans, playing is a free, impulsive
activity, engaged in for the fun of it, with improved game skills
coming as a result of the doing.  Rationals are just the opposite, in
that they mightily tax themselves with improving their skills during
play, which makes improvement come rather slowly and with great
difficulty.  In this sense the Artisans are the Rationals' mirror
image. (p. 184)
<P>
. . . Rationals tend over their lifetimes to collect a large repertoire
of skilled actions, few of which they employ very extensively.  In this
they are quite unlike the Artisans, who also become skillful.  For the
SPs, skills are opportunities for action and have no meaning if they
are not used, while for the NTs skills are competencies to be sharpened
through practice, then held in reserve until actually needed. (p. 189)
<P>
When ready to settle down, SPs may actually appear quite decisive in
their choice of mates, but this is apt to be the whim of the moment,
rather than the carefully thought through decision that would, for
instance, characterize an NT. (p. 216)
<P>
[Artisans] can even feel resentful of the NT's calm, detached life of
the mind, as if their own SP gift of physical pleasure is somehow
inferior when viewed from the NT's abstract heights. (p. 219)
<P>
NTs have difficulty allowing themselves to give up control and go with
their impulses and emotions and to express them freely and openly.  On
the contrary, Rationals try to govern their impulses and bend them to
their will by consciously evaluating them and analyzing them, which
effectively kills them [impulses, that is] in the process.  "Analysis,"
as Artisan athletes like to say, "is paralysis." (p. 245)
<P>
. . . if pushed too hard SP fun and games can come to seem frivolous
to NTs.  But, more than this, SPs can also disappoint their NT mates by
their general lack of interest in the internal world. . . . Rationals
are quick to note when interest wanes and their mates begin turning the
conversation to more concrete, down-to-earth matters. (pp. 248-249)
<P>
. . . unlike their utilitarian cousins, the SPs, NT children certainly
cannot base their self-respect on their boldness.  Theirs is an entirely
different base of self-respect: they must be autonomous. (p. 271)
<P>
As with the Idealist child, the Rational child can be a puzzle to
Artisan parents, who often cannot [understand] the child's interest in
logical investigation and technological development. (p. 277)
</P>

<H3>THE DIAGRAM</H3>

<P>
Keirsey's comments provide evidence for organizing the temperaments by
SJ-NF and SP-NT.  Now let's consider the deeper reasons for grouping the
temperaments in this way.
<P>
I've found it useful to remember each of the four temperaments with a
single word that sums up their primary goals.  Represented in graphical
form in my model, the structure looks like this:

<P>
Boiling it down to essentials, then, it seems that "Have" and "Feel" are
opposites, as are "Do" and "Think."  Does this conform with the
evidence of how the temperaments actually behave with each other?
</P>

<BR>
<H3>GUARDIANS AND IDEALISTS</H3>

<P>
For all the misunderstandings among the temperaments, that between SJ
Guardians and NF Idealists is one of the two strongest.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Guardians</H4>

<P>
Consider the Guardian "Have" preference.  For a Guardian, there is
something disturbingly wrong with a disordered world.  Only when things
are in their proper place does the SJ feel comfortable.  Though
generally not expressed consciously, there are certain questions that
SJs continually ask themselves.  Do I have a nice home, with functional
and well-maintained furnishings?  Do I have stable relationships with
others?  Do I have a solid family?  Do I have a job, and are the
requirements of that job clearly spelled out?
<P>
The way the Guardian measures the amount of structure in his or her
world is by possessions.  The relationships that define the SJ's world
are determined by the proximity of things, and the stability of those
relationships is maintained by owning them.  In other words, Guardians
decide whether they are happy or not by whether they can count on their
worldly possessions and relationships still being there tomorrow.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Idealists</H4>

<P>
NF Idealists, on the other hand, often consciously reject the notion of
defining their happiness by possessions.  The very word "Idealist"
evokes the concept of Platonic ideals, of perfect things without
physical forms that can be "owned."  My model describes these NFs as
concerned with "changing self."  This attitude is expressed in the ways
that NFs measure their happiness by how well they heed their "inner
voice."  Do I feel good about myself?  Have I done something good
today?  Am I a better person today than I was yesterday?  Have I made a
difference?
<P>
The nature of Idealists is to assume that perfection is possible, and to
seek it personally.  Everything is measured against that standard.  For
Introverted NFs, this often means personal sacrifice; for extroverted
NFs, others are expected to strive for the NF's vision of perfection,
too.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Guardians and Idealists Contrasted</H4>

<P>
The differences between "Have" and "Feel" show up in almost every aspect
of human life, but certain fields demonstrate these differences with a
vengeance.  Where Guardians enjoy the business world, Idealists are
inclined to perceive commerce as impersonal and "dirty," and to view
corporate executives as exploiters of the working class.  Furthermore,
Idealists, determined to change themselves and the world for the better,
personalize the Guardian resistance to change as a deliberate assault on
themselves and their goals.
<P>
Guardians, in turn, are equally suspicious of Idealist motives.  They
see the NF perfective impulse as an implicit statement that there is
something wrong with them and their SJ impulse toward preserving things
as they are.  The result is a rejection by Guardians of Idealists as
crusading busybodies who stir up trouble just to make themselves feel
useful.
<P>
What we should see here on both sides is the lack of comprehension of
the other's temperament.  Both Guardians and Idealists can see virtue
and utility in the Rational ability to plan and the Artisan ability to
act.  But SJs and NFs often see nothing of value at all in each other's
styles--their world-views are just too different.
<P>
Again, these sound very much like modern political distinctions.  I'm
fairly certain that most Idealists are today's liberals and most
Guardians are today's conservatives.  The language that individuals in
each of these groups use to criticize members of the other group fits
extremely well with what can be predicted by temperament theory.
<P>
Liberals, for example, call conservatives "reactionaries."  Seen in the
context of temperament, that word carries an implied recognition of the
conservative impulse to "conserve," to protect the structure of the
world as it exists.  That liberals clearly use the word as meaning
something bad also demonstrates the Idealist insistence that "changing
self" is more important than "structured world," that individual freedom
must always trump social restraint.
<P>
Conservatives, for their part, use the term "bleeding-heart" to describe
what they perceive as the liberal desire for personal good feelings no
matter what might be the real-world expense to others.  For conservative
Guardians, to exalt personal license at the expense of necessary social
order is selfish, childish, destructive, and wrong.
<P>
In short, liberals are concerned with rights, while conservatives are
concerned with duties.  Don't these sound exactly like the motivations
of Idealists and Guardians?
<P>
For a concrete example of this diametrical opposition, consider the 1996
presidential campaign.  After conservative candidate Bob Dole spoke of
returning to a simpler America of the past, candidate Bill Clinton
countered with a "bridge to the 21st century."  Conservatives, with
their Guardian preference for a structured world, saw the proper use of
political power as preserving what worked; liberals, with their Idealist
preference for a changing self, saw the proper political goal as
changing what wasn't working.  Both sides failed to understand the
temperament-determined impulse of the other side as worthwhile... and
the result of this mutual incomprehension was a presidential campaign
that capped forty years of personal demonization and a whipsawing of
public policy.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>ARTISANS AND RATIONALS</H3>

<P>
Although not as obvious in political terms, SP Artisans and NT Rationals
have a level of mutual incomprehension equivalent to that between
Guardians and Idealists.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Artisans</H4>

<P>
The Artisan "Do" preference is a natural way to describe the SP goal of
a "changing world."  For the Artisan, success in achieving this goal is
measured by the volume and variety of sensation.  Only in a "changing
world" is the SP truly happy, and this is seen in the kinds of questions
they ask themselves.  Is this new?  Is there some risk involved?  Will I
be remembered?  Does this give me the chance to move around, or to make
things happen?  Can I win?
<P>
Whatever it is, it's worthless to the Artisan if it doesn't make a
difference in the real world.  Anything that doesn't expand the SP's
opportunities to "Do" is considered useless; likewise, whatever can help
the SP to go or to do will be embraced.
<P>
When seen in this light of "changing the world," typical SP choices of
activity and work make sense.  The SP business negotiator or entertainer
gets a thrill from the split-second performance art of manipulating
people's desires.  The master craftsman enjoys using tools to shape
materials and construct useful things.  The SP jet pilot enjoys the
split-second physical demands of landing on the pitching deck of an
aircraft carrier at night in the rain.  Even the starving artist shares
in this need, this intense desire, to act in some way that alters the
world, even if just by a little.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Rationals</H4>

<P>
The NT Rational, like the NF Idealist, is more concerned with internal
goals than with satisfying worldly expectations.  But unlike Idealists,
Rationals are interested in bringing order to their inner selves by the
strict application of reason.  Above all, the NT wants a "structured
self"; anything else risks inefficiency and incompetence through a
failure of self-control and comprehension.  More than any other
temperament, a Rational's personal questioning can be extremely
self-critical.  Do I really understand this well enough?  Why did I
fail?  How does this work?  Why should I accept as true what others
claim to be true?  How can I improve?  How much of myself should I
reveal to others?  Is this the best option?  Do the costs of this
proposed course of action outweigh the benefits?
<P>
"Think about it" is the Rational's continual advice to him- or
herself.  "Look before you leap" rings true, too--especially if looking
involves knowing the advantages and disadvantages of leaping, as well as
<EM>why</EM> they are advantages and disadvantages.  To an NT, it's
never good enough to do something just to be doing it--there must always
be a reason.
<P>
This is how the NT relates to the world.  Success to a Rational requires
understanding both the situation and one's own capabilities, then acting
consciously to bring about the desired result.  If it wasn't deliberate,
then it doesn't count.
<P>
This emphasis on a "structured self" as a means by which the demands of
the world are addressed explains much Rational behavior.  If a Rational
seems slow to "open up," it may simply be a result of that Rational's
unwillingness to give a misleadingly incomplete response, or to
speculate in areas that the NT considers incompletely understood.  The
NT's insistence on understanding cause-and-effect relationships before
acting often leads them to cloistered lives in academia or opportunities
to indulge their passion for science and technology.  If it helps them
order and organize the universe, they're for it... a passion to which
other Rationals can relate, but which the non-Rational temperaments find
baffling.
</P>

<BR>
<H4>Artisans and Rationals Contrasted</H4>

<P>
As with Guardians and Idealists, so it is with Artisans and Rationals:
each temperament finds the other incomprehensible.  To both Artisans and
Rationals, Guardians and Idealists make some sense.  SJs and NFs both
provide reasons why things matter--a certainty which SPs and NTs find
comforting.  But SPs and NTs appear to each other to have nothing in
common.
<P>
To many Artisans, the calm, reserved Rational observation of SP activity
can be infuriating.  One cool glance from an NT, and many Artisans will
feel certain that they are being criticized for enjoying life.  They
often respond with withering dismissals of NT theorizing as a worthless
waste of time from pointy-headed, ivory-tower intellectuals.  Not only
(thinks the SP) do Rationals spend too much time worrying about things
that aren't real, they just plain don't know how to have fun.  An NT is
particularly vulnerable to this last charge (especially when seeing how
much fun the "undisciplined" Artisan seems to be having).
<P>
Rationals, for all their carefully acquired and organized knowledge of
themselves and their world, often don't understand the Artisan need for
freedom of movement in the world.  They correctly analyze SP activity as
being simply activity for its own sake, but then fail to understand that
it does have a purpose... just not a purpose of which they approve.  For
the SP, activity is a goal in itself; the NT finds this difficult to
even imagine.  What good is motion without meaning?  What is the point
of change without a defined purpose?
<P>
An even greater insult to the careful NT is how often the reckless SP
succeeds, gaining through enthusiasm and sheer <I>chutzpah</I> what the
NT could never achieve with any amount of persistence or intellectual
brilliance.  (This, while forgetting that what they themselves can
accomplish with their knowledge of how things work is just as impossible
for the typical Artisan.)  As a result, Rationals--as subject as anyone
to irrational emotional responses--will sometimes feel sufficiently
provoked to deny that Artisan achievements have any value.  If it took
no effort to obtain (they reason), then it was an undeserved victory.
<P>
The result of this mutual incomprehension is not merely a rejection of
each other's style.  Often both Artisans and Rationals feel a strange
combination of envy and pity for each other.  If Rationals envy Artisans
their <I>joie de vivre</I>, Artisans envy Rationals for their strong
sense of self.  Yet mirroring each of these envies is a feeling of
pity--Artisans pity Rationals for focusing on trivial details and for
being unable to "let go," while Rationals pity Artisans for being adrift
in the world with no idea of who they are or why they do what they do.
<P>
And in the end, Artisans and Rationals reject as fatally flawed each
other's temperamental styles, just as Guardians and Idealists deny any
value to their opposing styles.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>

<P>
In summary, then, I think this model of "opposite" temperaments has
better explanatory and predictive powers than Keirsey's.  This is not to
say that Keirsey's model, with its two differentiating axes of
"communication" (concrete or abstract) and "tool-use" (cooperative or
utilitarian), has no value, any more than the 16-type Myers-Briggs model
has no value because Keirsey later developed a different set of
analytical criteria.  Myers-Briggs, and Keirsey's analysis of opposites,
and mine, are all simply different ways to slice the same pie of human
character.
<P>
What I am suggesting is that some slicing mechanisms deliver more pie
than others... in the appropriate circumstances.  When the question is
"Which temperaments are most unlike each other?" I conclude that the
best--not the <EM>only</EM>, but the <EM>best</EM>--way to analyze the
available data is by examining temperament according to the two
differentiating axes of "source of truth" (world or self) and "comfort
with the unknown" (structure or change).
<P>
On that basis, I find that the behavior of the four temperaments,
especially toward each other, is explained well by the two divisions I
propose: "structured world" (SJ) versus "changing self" (NF), and
"changing world" (SP) versus "structured self" (NT).
<P>
The conclusive test, of course, will be to try out these definitions in
the real world.  They work for me, but I'm interested in hearing from
others who've given them a chance.
</P>
