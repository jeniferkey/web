<H3>III. MYERS-BRIGGS TYPE THEORY</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  One of those influenced by Jung's work was Isabel Briggs
Myers.  During World War II, she and her mother, Katherine Camp Briggs,
formalized the four aspects of personality uncovered by Jung.  They then
proceeded to gather data to determine whether or not her formalization
(and, as its basis, Jung's enumeration of primary behavioral
preferences) was justified.
<P>
  The first step was to establish a notation for expressing the two
possible choices for each of the four preferences.  The eventual
solution was an ordered string of four characters.
<P>
  In the first position was the preference for socialization or
solitude.  These were called "Extraversion" and "Introversion," and were
represented by the letters "E" and "I," respectively.
<P>
  In the second position was the preference for the source of
perceptions, called "iNtuition" and "Sensing."  Intuition was
represented by the letter "N" (since "I" had been taken by
Introversion); Sensing was represented by the letter "S."
<P>
  In the third position was the preference for the decision-making
process, either Thinking ("T") or Feeling ("F").
<P>
  And in the fourth and final position was the preference which guided
the choice between decision-making and perception, either Judging
(represented by "J") or Perceiving (represented by "P").
<P>
  Thus, four preferences with two choices each led to a complete system
of classification with sixteen possible combinations:

<P>
  To test whether each of these sixteen "types" constituted a unique
human personality style, and more generally whether or not the entire
system was adequate in practice, the researchers developed a written
questionnaire.  Individuals could read a question which specifically
tested on one of the four preferences, then mark the answer which best
described them.
<P>
  For example, consider the question: "When you're feeling some stress
in your life, where would you rather to go to unwind?  1) your
favorite pub, or 2) a quiet room of your home."  This question helps
determine whether the respondent more usually prefers extraversion or
introversion; other questions work in the same way.
<P>
  To help eliminate assessment error, the researchers tried to identify
several different ways in which each preference is expressed through
typical behavior.  Then they translated those behaviors into
questions.  By testing each preference with many different questions,
the accuracy of results was improved.
<P>
  Years of further testing and refinement followed.  Many of the results
can be found in one of the first books produced on what is now known as
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, <I>Gifts Differing</I>, but their overall
import is to show very high levels of correlation between the sixteen
Myers-Briggs types and actual personalities.
