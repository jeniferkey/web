  I think there's enough objective evidence for us to fairly say that some personality assessment models are better
  than others.  None is perfect... but we do others a disservice by accepting claims that one model is just as good
  as another, and thus that whichever model we recommend to others is simply a matter of personal taste.
<P>
  I've already pointed out one source of empirical data showing the high correlative value of the Myers-Briggs model
  (I.B. Myers <I>Gifts Differing</I>).  If you can provide me with direction to equally sound studies showing the equal or
  superior merit of the enneagram, I'd very much appreciate it--and I mean that sincerely.  I have no personal stake
  in the Myers-Briggs approach or any other; I only want to understand reality as best I can, whatever beliefs I have
  to shed in the process.
<P>
  Of course the corollary to this is that, unless I can find evidence to the contrary, I am forced to continue to
  assert that the enneagram--both its underlying theory and its empirical results--is less useful than the Briggs
  and Myers refinement of Jung's personality model.
<P>
  That's not enough, though.  To be fair, I think I need to address your defense of the enneagram.
<P>
  First, both the enneagram and the Myers-Briggs evaluations require an individual to answer questions about their
  preferences.  The only difference is that the Myers-Briggs often asks more questions than a typical enneagram, but
  this is not necessarily a flaw; in fact, it could as reasonably be said that asking more questions should lead us
  to invest more faith in the Myers-Briggs, as asking more questions reduces the chance of error in self-assessment.
<P>
  Second, there is this statement from someone's Introduction to Helen Palmer's book: "The system is so good that I
  have seen people able to pretend that they were psychic because they could type quickly and accurately and could
  consequently come up with an enormous amount of detailed personal information about someone they had barely met."
<P>
  This sounds intriguing... but it is ultimately unpersuasive.  For one thing, someone experienced in Myers-Briggs
  analysis can "type" a stranger quickly and accurately, too; at best, this is a draw between the two systems.  But
  the tie-breaker is this:  The best thing about the Myers-Briggs is precisely that it <EM>doesn't</EM> rely on seemingly
  "psychic" interpretations.
<P>
  I once personally tested the utility of Tarot cards.  I bought several decks; I studied several manuals; I thought
  hard about the Kabbalic interpretations (and others); I practiced.  And then I tested my understanding on someone
  whom I barely knew.
<P>
  She felt my "reading" was so accurate that she accused me of snooping somehow in her private family history.
<P>
  The same sort of thing applies to the other forms of "psychic" reading; a reasonably competent reader of human
  beings can sound amazingly knowledgable... and still be utterly fake.  So Ms. Palmer's endorsement of some third
  party being able to use the enneagram to amaze and astound listeners can't count for much.
<P>
  Besides, Ms. Palmer would hardly include an Introduction to a book she wished to sell that did <EM>not</EM> praise the
  enneagram, would she? *grin*
<P>
  Finally, I have to say that any faith I might have in the efficacy of the enneagram is seriously undermined by its
  claims to be a model based on an "ancient" system.  (And you are not the only person I've heard make this claim.)  In
  my experience, such claims of antiquity tend to be evidence of fraud.  They are usually attempts to convince people
  to stifle their perfectly reasonable questions in favor of dumb acquiescence.  Instead of explanations which reasonable
  people can investigate for themselves, they are simply smoke and mirrors: "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!"
<P>
  On these bases, I conclude that the enneagram is a barely-useful tool for personality self-assessment.  By no means
  do I suggest that interested persons ignore it.  But, given the limited supply of life each of us enjoys, I also
  counsel investing that time in personality models which have the greatest chance of paying off in dividends of human
  understanding... and right now, that's Myers-Briggs.
