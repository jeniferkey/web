<P>
  <I> The wonderful world of down sizing may have all the apologists in the world supporting it with
  fine prose and subtle argumentation, but the simple fact is that each of those who argue for down
  sizing and re-engineering either have never been down sized or are the ones who are doing the down
  sizing, not experiencing it. </I>
<P>
  <I> From my point of view, it is immoral as well. </I>
<P>
  As an emotional, highly personal complaint, this sounds persuasive.  As an objective economic
  argument, it fails completely.
<P>
  There's nothing "subtle" about the fact that a company which fails to earn a steady profit will
  go bankrupt, thus putting ALL its employees out of work.  Better to fire some so that others can
  remain employed.
<P>
  Attacking those who recognize this reality because they supposedly don't "care" as much as certain
  more "moral" persons is not only groundless, it's rude.  "I'm correct because I recognize immorality
  and you don't" isn't an argument; it's an admission that one lacks a strong argument based on
  objective reality.  Those with solid facts and reasoning to support their opinions should present them.
<P>
  <I> There is little more devastating, and little that preaches lack of worth to a person, like being
  canned because you have become superfluous. </I>
<P>
  "Superfluous" is an emotion word, not a rational argument.  Layoffs don't happen because those let go
  were "superfluous" or judged to be worthless as human beings.  They occur because the skills or
  functions of those particular employees were less valuable to their employer at a given moment in
  time than employees with other skills or performing other business functions.
<P>
  That is emphatically NOT the same thing as "worthless."  If I am a bricklayer and you are a neurologist
  looking for a partner, you don't have any use for my skills.  My business function is unnecessary to
  you; there is no good reason why you should employ me (and very good reasons why you should not be
  forced to employ me).  But just because <EM>you</EM> have no use for my business skills doesn't mean my
  skills are without value <EM>to someone else</EM>.
<P>
  So it is with all businesses.  Being laid off is in no way whatsoever a charge of personal worthlessness
  as you claim.
<P>
  <I> while in some cases, the ultimate result finds the individual better off than before, I doubt that
  happens more than five or ten percent of the time. </I>
<P>
  <I> It</I> [downsizing] <I>substitutes materiality for humanity. </I>
<P>
  Your doubt is not supported by the evidence.  According to a business report I read several months after
  the layoff of 40,000 AT&T employees--a period that generated much moralistic breast-beating and warning
  of Dire Consequences--approximately 80 percent of the laid-off employees had new jobs within a month.  So
  of course these persons became better off than they were before--before, they worked for a company that
  demonstrated it did not need their skills.
<P>
  As for the other one-fifth, some of them took early retirement, while others started businesses of their
  own which resulted in new hiring to further offset the layoffs . . . and which <EM>never would have
  happened</EM> without the layoffs.
<P>
  Were there some persons for whom losing their jobs left them worse off for more than a month?  Undoubtedly,
  and no singing the praises of layoffs should ignore this reality.  Some people were worse off.  As a
  fellow human being, I feel compassion for them; I wouldn't like to be in that position, either.  (If it
  matters, I nearly was in that position in early 1998, when my employer became a target for a hostile
  takeover that surely would have resulted in massive layoffs.  Had that happened, I assure you that I
  would still make exactly the same argument I am making here and now.)
<P>
  But--and this is the point that matters--overall, everybody was better off after the AT&T layoff, and so
  it is in most (though not all) such cases.  Everybody (a word I don't use loosely) in our society was
  better off because AT&T became a healthier company.  We all profit by its continued existence.  We all
  would have been worse off if it had been forced by someone's misguided notion of "compassion" to be a
  social welfare institution instead of a business.  Failed businesses, even if the intentions of their
  directors are as socially pure as can be, employ <EM>no one</EM>.
<P>
  It matters not one whit how "greedy" or "materialistic" some CEO or corporate board of directors may
  be.  If that company is alive and employing people, it does infinitely more social good than a company
  whose noble and "human" chief leads that company into bankruptcy so that it no longer employs anyone
  at all.  (Nor is the old "executive compensation" argument of any value here; by far the vast majority
  of any company's revenue--no matter how nice or nasty its executives--goes to employee paychecks.)
<P>
  Of course it's upsetting to an individual when his or her stable income is threatened.  But no one has
  asserted otherwise!  Pretending that anyone has done so is merely going after a weak straw man argument;
  it avoids the real question.
<P>
  The real question is whether more good is done by letting businesses make their own decisions concerning
  their corporate health, or by imposing hiring requirements on businesses in order to satisfy some
  outsider's theory of proper labor practices.  Several hundred years of capitalism strongly suggest
  that, in the long run, trying to impose social utopias by force does far less good--and often far more
  harm--than defending the rights of businesses and individuals to freely negotiate the value of labor.
<P>
  That's not being insensitive.  It's being realistic about what has been proven to promote social good,
  and what feels good but fails.
<P>
  I submit that realism is more helpful than questioning the motives of those who disagree with us.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
  <I> will the U.S. ever face another severe depression, massive amounts of people lacking work,
  "Grapes Of Wrath"-style?  If so, what do you think the government's role, if any, should be in
  helping people get back to work? </I>
<P>
  That, I actually don't have so much trouble with.
<P>
  There's a theory I've been kicking around in my head for a few years that informs my thinking on
  this and other questions of the appropriate uses of centralized state power.  It goes something
  like this: the Executive branch, like the military, is explicitly organized in a hierarchical
  command structure.  In other words, an order comes from the single top dog; it is directed to an
  authorized representative of that executive, who develops policies and procedures by which
  individuals will do the work that is thought will achieve the stated goal.
<P>
  The thing is, not every problem is best solved by a hierarchical power system.  Particularly when
  we're talking about a government--and most especially a national government--applying a top-down
  approach enforced by the state's power to impose fines, jail time, and sharpshooters/tanks, there
  are times when it is more effective to employ persuasion to try to get individuals to voluntarily
  act in whatever way is thought appropriate.
<P>
  In my view, most things fall into that latter category.  As a general principle, we--individually
  and as communities, states and a nation--are better off when the national executive restrains
  itself from exerting its power.  For some people (OK, I'm thinking the current crowd, but while
  some hands are meaningfully dirtier than others, no Administration's hands since Washington's are
  perfectly clean), this is very hard to do.  How can an executive earn praise in the history books
  by <EM>restraining</EM> himself from action?
<P>
  So they meddle.  And instead of people exercising their powers of self-reliance--the powers that
  are directly responsible for making this nation what it is by insisting that every citizen
  demonstrate self-government--we are excused from responsibility for our actions, and even
  prevented from taking responsibility for our choices.
<P>
  Bad idea.
<P>
  It has become a key part of my world-view that a government should do only those things which
  individual citizens in free association with one another either cannot or should not do for
  themselves.  When it does, it acts against its own long-term best interests by not permitting
  and expecting its citizens to demonstrate intelligent and active self-government.
<P>
  On that basis, I think most of what all three branches of the U.S. government have been up to
  in the past few decades is wrong.  But "most" is not "all."
<P>
  Specifically (yes, I'm finally getting around to answering your question *grin*), the
  hierarchically-organized Executive is probably exactly the right crowd to deal with truly
  national emergencies.  It has the power to act, and--if matters really are that serious, as in
  a massively debilitating economic crisis--the right and responsibility to act.
<P>
  The ends do not justify all means, however.  There is no national emergency bad enough to
  require stormtroopers, secret police, or concentration camps; if these are the only means by
  which a nation can survive, then better that it perish.
<P>
  Short of this, though... I'm inclined to agree that a <EM>real</EM> Depression would justify
  large-scale public works projects.  Better some productive activity than none at all, even if
  the public confidence is too low to offer wages much beyond those necessary for survival.  So
  yes, I'd support executive action in such a serious case.
<P>
  Otherwise... call me skeptical.
<P>
  <I> There are some real  *astards out there in the upper-echelons of certain businesses who don't
  see people, when they look at employees, but only see pieces of equipment.  I'm throwing this out
  for discussion, not because I think the government should put any further restrictions on business,
  it shouldn't... in my opinion, but because I've seen the result when a gentle elderly woman who's
  worked at her job for over twenty years, is suddenly told to pack up and move out the next day
  because her employer has decided they don't need her department anymore,no notice... just pack up
  and get the hell out.  The fear and anguish and disruption of a person's life is very real. </I>
<P>
  Quite true.  What I wonder is, why do we even bring this up?  Is there really anyone Out There who
  thinks otherwise?
<P>
  The question isn't whether layoffs hurt individuals over the short run (they do), or even whether
  corporate executives may profit by layoffs over the short run (they may).  The proper question to
  be asking is whether businesses have the right to make stupid decisions that hurt them in the long
  run.  If they do, then we may all deplore the short-term results, but still accept their necessity
  to gain the long-term benefits of companies that survive by remaining profitable, keeping other
  workers employed.  That doesn't mean ignoring an individual's pain.  What it means is making
  large-scale public policy questions on the appropriate basis--not based on personal feelings or
  horror stories that are not representative examples of reality, but on objective observations and
  analyses of economic cause-and-effect.
<P>
  If, on the other hand, we conclude that businesses don't have any right to be foolish; if we accept
  the twin assumptions that businesses--and thus the individual human beings who run businesses--are
  too stupid or evil to be allowed to make their own decisions as to what is in their best interests
  over the long run, and that consumers are too stupid to make "correct" choices as to which
  businesses to support, then we might as well just nationalize everything and let those wise and
  benevolent civil servants take care of us completely.
<P>
  In which case the good and decent employers are prevented from being so, and no one else has any
  incentive to become so.
<P>
  And we all lose.
</P>

<HR>

<P>
  <I> People do suffer long-term hurt, especially the senior citizens for whom new work will be an
  incredible trial.  Of course you can't force a business to keep employees that it can no longer
  afford.  But business practices that are cruel to the individual need to be brought to the
  attention of the public, so that some pressure can be brought to bear on the corporate mentality. </I>
<P>
  Understood.  And I hope you will understand in turn my pointing out that word "cruel" as being key here.
<P>
  What's "cruel?"  Suppose you're an employer who hits a bad patch.  You can't afford to keep all
  of your employees; if you try, you run a high risk of going under completely and losing <EM>all</EM>
  your employees.
<P>
  So what do you do?  Your older employees are likely to be earning the most money (i.e., costing
  you the most in wages).  You could let maybe three or four of them go; otherwise you'd have to
  lay off maybe five or six others.  On the other hand, you don't want to be "cruel" to "senior
  citizens."  But letting too many others go might cripple your business just in terms of how much
  work needs doing.
<P>
  So what do you do?
<P>
  Suppose you try to keep everyone... wouldn't that be "cruel," risking everyone's jobs?
<P>
  Suppose you try to protect your older workers.  Doesn't that mean you have to be "cruel" to
  lower-income workers, who probably need your paycheck just to make ends meet?
<P>
  My point should be obvious by now, which is that there is <EM>no way</EM> to avoid being
  "cruel" to someone when employee costs are too high.  When all the options are bad, the only
  proper course is to do what's best for the company.  It means that someone is going to be hurt
  in the short term, and there's no way around that.
<P>
  So the notion that letting people go to pursue the bottom line is always "cruel" is based
  on failing to consider the consequences of doing otherwise.  Layoffs are not cruel, not when
  the bottom line is risking the bankruptcy that, instead of hurting a few people, would
  "cruelly" hurt everyone who benefits by that company's continued existence.
<P>
  I think we need to be careful to consider that, as bad as things can be when there are layoffs,
  things can be much, much worse.  A proper assessment of economic action considers all the
  alternatives, not just those which purport to avoid "cruelty" to a particular interest group.
</P>
