<H3>INFJ -- The Author</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  To the INFJ, describing the world helps to figure out one's own
identity.  The iNtuition of INFJs supplies the "answers," their Judging
tells them that their answers are the right ones, and their Feeling
impels them to share those answers with the world.
<P>
  Extensive social contact can be unwelcome, though, so the INFJ often
resorts to less personal communication: writing.  Not every INFJ becomes
a writer, but most do find ways to exercise their gift of
expression.  The dual impulses to improve individuals and avoid too much
social interaction lead INFJs to enjoy fields where they can work in
private or one-on-one with people, such as the ministry, as general
practitioners in medicine, and as psychological therapists.
<P>
  INFJs sometimes feel as if they are being pulled in two
directions.  On the one hand they enjoy personal contact, as long as
that contact is not merely superficial.  On the other hand they can be
very sensitive to criticism, even to the point of suffering from poor
health when their personal or professional lives become discordant.
<P>
  For this reason, INFJs can be hard to get to know.  Often they feel
they don't even know themselves very well, so having to explain their
motivations to others can be extremely frustrating.  Sometimes this
causes them to develop an attitude of roughness--a crusty veneer
intended to keep people at a distance.  This is a shame, because INFJs
often do understand the motivations of others very well, and have a
talent for communicating that understanding which is lost when the INFJ
withdraws.
