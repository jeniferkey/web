<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER><P><B>B. Causal Fallacies</B></P></CENTER>

<TD>
<B>1. Confusion of a Necessary with a Sufficient Condition</B>

     physicist like them?"</P>

<B>3. <I>Post Hoc</I> Fallacy</B>

     utilities stocks dropped twenty percent!  No more ladders for me!"</P>

     programs, so I guess welfare causes crime."</P>

<TD>
<B>4. Confusion of Cause and Effect</B>
<P>(Assertion which mistakes the order of events)</P>
</TD>
<TD>

     building roads made people want to drive."</P>

</TR>
<TR>

<TD>
<B>6. Domino Fallacy</B>
<P>(Assertion that a particular event will
initiate a chain of events which lead inexorably to some negative end
result (sometimes called the "slippery slope" argument); the problem
is that each link in the chain of the argument must be supported by
its own evidence and logic)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"Once we start start letting more immigrants in, they'll bring their
     families, and their families will bring <EM>their</EM> families, and the
     next thing you know, we're all speaking Chinese."</P>
   <P>"If they're allowed to cut one red cent out of the assistance programs
     we fought so hard for, people will go hungry, they'll be forced to
     turn to crime, and then the people who said 'let them find jobs' will
     get what they deserve."</P>

<P>(Assertion based on belief that unconnected events really are causally
