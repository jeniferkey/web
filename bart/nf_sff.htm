<H2>Overview</H2>

<BR>
<P>
As the emotional aspect of personality deals with the possible, with
what might be, it seems the natural place to think of the highly
imaginative genres of science fiction and fantasy.
<P>
In a sense, to write good books in these genres requires more than the
focus on character found in the mainstream "literary" novel.  The
literary novel is difficult to write in two ways.  First, it requires
the author to take a microscope to his characters.  Through plot, all
nonessentials are stripped away, leaving their primal motivations bare
to our scrutiny.  This deep understanding of motivation is difficult to
obtain, and even more difficult to communicate believably in fiction.
<P>
This leads to the second difficulty, the "believability" requirement.  A
genre novelist is free to send his characters nearly anywhere, but a
literary novelist must consciously pin down his characters like bugs in
order to force them to reveal their innermost natures.  While a genre
novelist can use multiple settings to show different sides of a
character's nature, a literary novelist will deliberately hold the
setting static so as to concentrate exclusively on the characters.  So
literary settings are conventionally simple, normal and believable: the
home, the job, the town, the university, all as they currently exist.
<P>
Not having to engage in this relentless focus on character to the
exclusion of all else does indeed--in one sense--make genre fiction
easier to write than literary fiction.  But it is a tradeoff.  Genre
novels, like their literary cousins, still must not only reveal
something about the human condition through the thoughts and deeds of
the characters depicted; they must adhere also to the special rules
of the genre.  This doesn't make good genre novels easy to write, as the
pure literary types like to imply--it makes them <I>hard</I> to write,
at least in the sense of satisfying multiple constraints.
<P>
The freedom of science fiction and fantasy writers to create worlds
allows these writers to explore character in settings not available to
literary writers.  But this freedom comes at a price: new settings must
be unique to each author; they must be carefully designed to be
internally consistent; and they must contribute materially to each story
being told.
<P>
A literary novelist who thinks this is easy should try it.
</P>

<H2>My Views</H2>

<BR>
<H3>Fantasy</H3>

<BR>
<P>
One of the single most important persons in the field of fantasy
literature was Lin Carter.  Not because he was a particularly gifted
fantasist himself (although most of his own fantasy stories were
competently crafted and fun to read), but because he served as
editor of Ballantine's Adult Fantasy Series.
<P>
This series consisted of reprintings of the best and most significant
fantasy novels ever written.  Carter's knowledge in this area was
immense; he was as comfortable with the intricacies of the Western
tradition as with the tales of other times and cultures.  From the myths
related by Plato and Herodotus to the adventures of Br'er Rabbit as
told through "Uncle Remus" by Joel Chandler Harris; from the dark
stories as originally collected by the Brothers Grimm to the cynical
fables of Aesop; from the doings of the Chinese trickster-figure Monkey
to the childish behavior of the gods of Mount Olympus and Asgard;
Carter's fantastic scholarship ranged time and space.  He was exactly
the right person to edit a series of the best fantasies ever written.
<P>
The range of the novels selected by Carter for Ballantine's Adult
Fantasy series was correspondingly broad.  Where one novel might be from
a name as well-known as William Morris (the genius who also gave his
name to the style of furniture he created), Carter also took care to
seek out the gems from obscure writers like Hope Mirlees and David
Lindsay.
<P>
The styles of the novels offered differed widely as well.  The murky
allegory of Lindsay's <I>A Voyage to Arcturus</I> contrasted with the
light humor of Lord Dunsany's <I>The Charwoman's Shadow</I>.  Set
against the glooming Gothic menace of Mervyn Peake's <I>Titus Groan</I>
was the glittering Elizabethan adventure <I>The Worm Ouroboros</I> by a
twentieth-century British civil servant named E.R. Eddison.  Carter made
sure that the source classics were included in the series, such as
George MacDonald's <I>Lilith</I>, but he also celebrated the imagination
of unexpected authors, such as William Beckford whose Arabian novel
<I>Vathek</I> nearly outdoes Scheherazade.  For readers whose only
knowledge of fantasy consisted of Tolkien's remarkable (but limited)
"Lord of the Rings" cycle, Lin Carter's dedication to cultivating
the roots of Tolkien's work opened up a path into an enchanted forest
that spanned worlds.
<P>
The bad news is that the Adult Fantasy series lasted only from the late
1960s through the 1970s, and Carter is no longer available to extend it
with fresh discoveries.  The good news is that many of the books in the
series can still be found in used book stores and science fiction
conventions.  It is still possible to be transported to impossible
worlds of fell demons, brave heroes, treacherous cowards, malign wizards,
gentle (but spirited!) maidens, and the frozen mountains, sunny archipelagos,
and ancient green hills far beyond the fields we know.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>Science Fiction</H3>

<BR>
<P>
Science fiction inhabits a special realm part-way between fantasy and
the pure literary novel.  Where the literary novel fictionalizes the
minutiae of modern daily life, science fiction's subject matter is
whatever is possible in the entire universe.  But where fantasy embraces
plot devices that are specifically portrayed as supernatural, a science
fiction story must base its wonders on plausible technology.
<P>
It's true that this would seem to portray science fiction as a more
constricting garment than pure fantasy.  (And make of the standard
literary novel a torturer's "boot.")  Where a fantasist is free to make
anything at all happen (so long as whatever caused it to happen remains
logically consistent), the science fiction writer must work within the
confines of reality.  Anything that happens in a science fiction world
must have at least a scientifically plausible technical explanation.
<P>
This is usually accomplished by taking a hard look at the historical
roots of some modern technology, then guessing what might come next and
inventing a reasonable chain of events leading from the present to the
imagined future.  Minimally, this involves logical thinking about the
technology in question, but science fiction writers go well beyond the
technology.  They also consider the potential social and personal
consequences of such technologies.
<P>
Designing worlds isn't just about figuring out planetary orbits and how
robots behave; it's also about culture.
<P>
Science fiction produces new ways of looking at character.
<P>
There was a period in which this wasn't true.  In the 1930s, '40s and
'50s, science fiction tended to be about the technology, rather than
about people.  There were some writers who insisted on writing good
stories first and good science fiction stories second, but they were
swamped by the "Giant Electronic Brain" and "Little Green Men" school
of hack writers.  This was the period of time in which we first heard
Forrest Ackerman's term "sci-fi," which is now best applied to similar
schlock (as seen on TV and in theaters).
<P>
But it wasn't always that way.  Early writers of what we today recognize
as science fiction ("SF" for short)--authors such as Jules Verne, H.G.
Wells, and Aldous Huxley--used technology not merely as a throwaway plot
gimmick but to ask questions about the effects on human society of such
technological marvels.  Able to see something of what lay in store for
Scientific Man in the twentieth century, such writers as these and those
who followed them tried to imagine what the consequences of such
astonishing new powers would be on regular men and women.  In many
cases, they guessed wrong... but they were asking the right question.
<P>
The "British Invasion" of the 1960s began to restore that focus.  Though
cynical, writers like Brian Aldiss and Michael Moorcock reintroduced the
concept that what distinguished SF wasn't iron-jawed heroes riding
silver rocket ships--it was the human relationship with technological
power.
<P>
This new human-focused breed of writer inherited the tradition preserved
by the Golden Age authors who never succumbed entirely to the hack
fixation on gleaming machinery; writers like Poul Anderson, Isaac
Asimov, Leigh Brackett, Frederic Brown, Robert A. Heinlein, Cyril
Kornbluth, C.L. Moore, Fredrik Pohl, and Robert Sheckley.
<P>
These pioneers kept true SF alive for the humanists who followed, such
as Alfred Bester, Gordon Dickson, Frank Herbert, Ursula Le Guin, Robert
Silverberg, Jack Vance, and Roger Zelazny.  Even self-deprecating humor
became possible, as in Douglas Adams's "Hitchhiker" books and Harry
Harrison's tales of the "Stainless Steel Rat."
<P>
Eventually, though, the self-deprecating response to techno-optimism
mutated into bitter self-condemnation.  The advent of undreamt-of
computing power available to every individual led some writers to
envision, not the chiseling off of another fetter on human liberty, but
cybernetic dystopias: the "cyberpunk" sub-genre.  Bruce Stirling was
soon joined by others sharing this pessimistic vision of technology as a
chaotic force splintering human society.  The positive concept of
technology as a catalyst for new opportunities--the optimism of the
Golden Age science fiction writers--is explicitly rejected.  Cyberpunk
is the story of Frankenstein's monster retold.  The special effects are
from Industrial Light and Magic, but the story is the same: Man uses
technology to gain power over forces he does not understand and cannot
control, and in the end those forces destroy him.
<P>
Since this form of science fiction reached its popularity peak in the
late 1980s, the pendulum now has swung to the other extreme.  Mirroring
the trend in U.S. universities for such self-indulgent mush as "gender
studies" and "queer theory," editors and publishers in the late 1990s
are buying more explicitly feminist and gay science fiction.  While
cyberpunk focused on the domination of humans by machines, 1990s
science fiction writers such as Nicola Griffith describe technology as
a force for the liberation of personal license.  As contraceptive
technology has today liberated women from reproductive bondage (so the
theory goes), tomorrow's technology will liberate other "oppressed"
groups from the narrow-mindedness of those who would preserve social
limits on various human behaviors.
<P>
Yet the seeds of change are already being sown again.  Relying on
technology to nullify the undesired consequences of risky behaviors has
proven a poor substitute for personal self-control, as the increasing
rate of illegitimacy in the U.S. demonstrates.  A habit of self-control
pays dividends far beyond preventing contraception (for example), but a
dependence on technology as a way to dodge personal responsibility for
our actions leads to social breakdown as the dodges fail.
<P>
As the public learns this hard lesson, and begins to rebel against the
abolition of self-control (as forecast by the election of a conservative
majority in both houses of the U.S. Congress), it seems likely that
science fiction will follow.  One possibility is that we will begin to
see more religion in science fiction.  Perhaps the publication after so
many years of a sequel to Walter Miller's classic <I>A Canticle for
Leibowicz</I> is the first harbinger in SF of a public rejection of
technology as a way to finesse voluntary adherence to difficult ethical
standards.
<P>
The wave of technology-optimistic SF may be about to crest again.
