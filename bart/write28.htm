  <I> "I have the right to my opinion as a citizen of these United States of America".  And
  on a personal level, I have tried to extend that to everyone I know.  I may not agree with
  someone's opinion, but I'm sure glad they have one!  Life would be dull and boring without
  one. </I>
<P>
  Mmm, yes, but... not every statement is an opinion.
<P>
  If I say, "The president is a crook," that's an opinion.  (If I'm a lawyer in Little Rock
  or Washington, it might be more than that, but let's assume we're just private citizens
  talking here.)  To support my opinion, I can offer salient facts and reasoning; if you
  disagree, you can counter with other facts and reasoning.  There's nothing personal about
  this discussion, since we're dealing in facts.  So by all means, any opinion should be
  welcome.  (And, I might add, people who express such opinions in public don't have any
  business taking responses personally.)
<P>
  If I say, "Those lousy Red Sox--they're bums, every last one of 'em!" that's an opinion,
  too.  It's more subjective than an opinion about some matter of public record and public
  interest, but there's some objective facts involved here, so it's still an opinion.  Sure,
  I care about what I'm saying, but who I am as a person isn't determined by whether or not
  I'm right--it's just an opinion.  So a statement like this is fair game for heated
  discussion, too.
<P>
  If I say, "I like my eggs scrambled, not runny," we've moved out of the realm of opinion
  and into personal tastes.  Yes, it deals with an aspect of external reality--maybe scrambled
  eggs aren't as healthy as other preparations--so it might be possible to get into a
  discussion about this... but why bother?  How you like your eggs is highly subjective;
  there's just no basis for insisting that "my opinion is better than yours" on such things.
<P>
  Finally, if I say, "Once upon a time, this thing happened to me..." then that is totally
  not a matter of opinion.  It is personal experience; it is completely subjective; it is
  not a proper subject for debate.  If someone tries to use it as conclusive proof of some
  argument, then it's fair to reject it <EM>for that purpose</EM> (since other people may
  have different experiences).  But in and of itself, it's pointless to try to refute
  personal experience, and rude even to attempt it.
<P>
  So what I'm saying is this: the more subjective a statement, the less value or propriety
  there is in matching it with some equivalent statement of your own (and vice-versa).  In
  other words, sure, sometimes it's fine to match opinion with opinion.  But not all the
  time, because not every statement is an opinion.
<P>
  But enough are, luckily, to keep life from being dull and boring. *grin*
