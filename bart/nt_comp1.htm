<P>
"Word on the street has Netscape in takeover talks with several industry
powerhouses."
<P>
And one of the names being mentioned as a possible suitor is AOL... which
actually might make good business sense.
<P>
The purpose of computing has always been "access to information."  For
there to be an actual computing "industry," three elements have to be
present: a sufficient number of end-users with access to computing
hardware; information which users want (often called "content" these
days); and the access point--the software which allows users to connect
to the content.
<P>
By the 1970s, when computing finally hit its stride, mainframe computers
were the only game in town.  Since IBM was by far the biggest supplier
of the hardware on which information was stored, and since one normally
used their operating systems to access that information, IBM profited
most.  In the second half of the decade, minicomputer companies such as
DEC and HP made inroads into the business computing market by providing
lower-cost hardware (which allowed more users to access content).  But
IBM offered its own minicomputer line, and retained its dominance.  IBM
was king because a majority of the user base accessed content primarily
through IBM software.
<P>
In the 1980s, many more users gained access to isolated personal
computers.  Since it was convenient, that's where they stored their
content.  So the key access point was each computer's operating
system.  Whoever could supply the operating system that best allowed
users to access local content would profit most.  At this time,
although Apple had some success with its Apple ][ and Macintosh
computers, the 1980s belonged to Microsoft.  Microsoft did more than
IBM could; it allowed many more users to quickly access the information
they really wanted.  And Microsoft fared better than Apple because the
hardware still mattered... and the "open" design of the PC meant that
more peripherals were available at lower prices than could be found for
the proprietary Macintosh.  So although the number of Apple
hardware/software users grew during the 1980s, the number of
PC/Microsoft users grew much faster.  And thus, in the 1980s, a
majority of the user base accessed content primarily through Microsoft
software.  Microsoft was king.
<P>
The 1990s have been the Networked Decade.  As more personal computers
were connected to one another, content migrated off of the PC and onto
high-speed, high-capacity file servers.  In the first half of this
decade, that meant Local Area Networks--LANs.  Novell, the maker of the
NetWare network operating system, held a commanding position at this
time, seeming to rival Microsoft.  Why?  Because Novell owned the means
by which users accessed content.  As more information left the desktop,
the importance of the PC operating system decreased, and the importance
of the network operating system increased.  Novell was in a position to
be the Microsoft of the 1990s, but--for various reasons--it never
capitalized on its opportunity.
<P>
By the mid-1990s that opportunity was gone, bypassed by the explosion
of access links to the Internet.  Once again content began to migrate,
this time from file servers limited to business users to servers "out
there" in the world which offered access to any and all users.  The
user base, which in its quest for content had flocked to online
services such as CompuServe, GEnie, Prodigy and AOL, began to adopt
the World Wide Web in huge numbers... and the company which controlled
the access point this time was Netscape.  By offering for free Marc
Andreesen's version of the Mosaic browser, Netscape quickly amassed an
astonishing 90 percent share of the potentially huge Web browser
market.  Netscape virtually owned the new access point.
<P>
But Microsoft, whatever one may think of its business practices, has
never been run by lazy or unimaginative executives.  Microsoft first
tried to compete with Novell, and--while the LAN boom lasted--was
beginning to win that battle.  When the Web became the content source
of choice, Microsoft reacted quickly, and in two directions.  First,
it recognized the value of content ownership; witness Bill Gates
acquiring the rights to numerous electronic publishing houses, as
well as the rights to electronically display the great historical
works of art.  Also, note Microsoft's creation of its own online
service, MSN, which created a user base by offering content.  Second,
Microsoft very quickly scavenged the programming talent necessary to
develop its own Web browser, which it began integrating into Windows
95 to (successfully, if perhaps not legally) take market share from
Netscape.  Thus Microsoft leverages its still-commanding position in
the PC operating system market to gain more control over the new
content access point.
<P>
Now come rumors that AOL might buy Netscape.  This is interesting
because it would link AOL's very large user base with the
still-dominant content access technology: Netscape's Web
browser.  If any combination could provide a challenge to
Microsoft's dominance of computing, as Microsoft in its day usurped
IBM's crown, an AOL-Netscape merger might be it.
<P>
[Note: As of 1998/12/23 this has now happened--Netscape has agreed
to be purchased by America On-Line.  This creates another company with
a large (and profitable) user base and a self-controlled means of
accessing content.  Strategically, however, Microsoft is still ahead,
as it has now spent several years acquiring copyrights on various
forms of the Web's most desirable content--the third element required
for industry domination.  It remains to be seen whether this will prove
to be the controlling element, especially in light of the U.S. Dept. of
Justice's attack on Microsoft's operating system monopoly.]
<P>
I consider all this to be a graphic example of why those who would
penalize market-dominating "monopolies" for their success are
impatiently short-sighted and therefore often wrong....
