<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Arnold Toynbee was not one of these.  In his multi-volume work, <I>The
Study of History</I>, Toynbee explicitly rejected the formulation of
human history as cyclical and, thus, inevitably leading to decay.  (It
should be noted that his work addressed considerably more than just the
topic of whether history repeats.  That history is not cyclical is
one intermediate conclusion Toynbee drew; it is not the "point" of his
work.  It just happens to be the one part with which I'm concerned in
this discussion.)
</P>

<BR>
<H2>Similar Parts, Different Wholes</H2>

<P>
In his youth, Toynbee explains, he became interested in the question of
why civilizations die.  In trying to answer this question, he was led to
ask the prefatory questions of why civilizations change, and why they
emerge in the first place.  Over a lifetime of study and thought,
Toynbee developed the logical consequences of his realization that new
things can come into existence that are not living organisms.  Unchained
from the restrictions of the old biological metaphor of civilization-as-life, he
was free to perceive social transformation in a new way.
<P>
Toynbee's model was the loom.  Even though a clothmaker uses repetitive
motions in the production of fabric, changing the pattern laid out on
the frame will result in a different kind or appearance of cloth being
woven.  Likewise, civilizations (according to Toynbee) may contain
similar elements and yet be unique.  They may all be composed of the
same materials, acted upon by the same forces, but still turn out
differently in the end.
</P>

<BR>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
"The West is not doomed," Toynbee seemed to be insisting.  "It is not
irrational to hope for the survival of our culture."
