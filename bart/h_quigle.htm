<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
THe foreign policy of the United States in the second half of the
twentieth century owes a great deal to Carroll Quigley. As a professor
of history at Georgetown University, Quigley was noted for his clear
and forceful communication of history. (Though he might have preferred
to describe his his approach as "scientific" or "analytical.")
<P>
Quigley expressed his methods and conclusions in his book <I>The Evolution
of Civilizations: An Introduction to Historical Analysis</I>.  In a direct
(and sometimes acerbic) way, he presented the argument for an objective
analysis of history.  Neither Spengler's resigned pessimism nor
Toynbee's determined optimism made sense to Quigley; for him, history
should be perceived and analyzed without being directed by wishful
thinking, or by being interpreted so as to support some cherished
hypothesis of human nature.
</P>

<H2>The Features of a Civilization</H2>

<P>
Quigley describes the <A HREF="h_quigl1.htm">six features</A> by which a
civilization can be analyzed.

<H2>Quigley's Fundamental Observations</H2>

<P>
The heart of Quigley's book (and his understanding of civilizations) are
his <A HREF="h_quigl2.htm">three insights</A> into the form and change
of civilizations.

<H2>The Seven Stages of Civilization</H2>

<H2>Quigley's Shadows</H2>

Although it does not appear to have affected his conceptualization of

<H2>Of Special Interest: Carroll Quigley and Bill Clinton</H2>

<P>
While doing research on the Web for this essay, I found a remarkable
article by David Wilkinson of UCLA. We know the facts: Bill Clinton was
a student of Carroll Quigley, considered him one of his two most
influential professors at Georgetown, praised Quigley in his first
nomination speech, and read <I>The Evolution of Civilizations</I> again
in 1994 (if a review of that book on Amazon.com by a Clinton associate
is to be believed).
<P>
Given these facts, Wilkinson asks the obvious question: How much of what
Quigley taught was put into practice by his student, Bill Clinton, when
that student became President of the United States?
<P>
Wilkinson's article addresses that question up to 1995. It is a somewhat
long but absolutely fascinating bit of writing, with insights into not
only Clinton but Quigley as well. My "bias" antennae were fully
extended, but I found Wilkinson's discussion to be fair, objective,
grounded in facts, and even funny in places.
<P>
It should be added that this article is written at a fairly high level
of erudition. But if you're willing to accept the occasional
Buckleyisms (such as "praxis" and "oikumene"), you'll be rewarded. There
is some really first-class thinking and communication here, and I
encourage anyone interested in seeing historial analysis put into
action (or not, as their political beliefs may incline them) to take the
time to read this piece.
<P>
You can read Wilkinson's article

TARGET="new">here</A>. The full title is: "From Mesopotamia through
Carroll Quigley to Bill Clinton: World Historical Systems, the
Civilizationist, and the President".
