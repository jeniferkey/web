  Apparently this is for real.  Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled... this one's for ye! *grin*
<P>
  It seems that the U.S. Government has decided to make April 6 "National Tartan Day."  While I
  generally consider such resolutions giant wastes of time (in other words, a Good Thing,
  considering what damage Congress might be doing otherwise), this time they at least managed
  to find something worth celebrating.  Specifically, the Declaration of Arbroath mentioned
  below, which was indeed a document that insisted on liberty and did it in no uncertain terms.
<P>
  Here's the text of the Senate Resolution.
</P>
<HR>
<CENTER>
<B>NATIONAL TARTAN DAY</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar
  No. 328 S. Res. 155.
<P>
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.
<P>
  The legislative clerk read as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  A resolution (S. Res. 155) designating April 6th as 
National Tartan Day to recognize the outstanding achievements 
and contributions made by Scottish Americans to the United 
States.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate consideration of the resolution?
<P>
  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.
<P>
  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to Chairman Hatch and members of
  the Judiciary Committee for expediting this legislation, because the time was running out
  and we wanted to get this in effect before this April 6 date. On behalf of all of us of
  Scottish descent, we appreciate this recognition of Tartan Day.
<P>
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution is agreed to.
<P>
  The resolution (S. Res. 155) was agreed to.<BR>
  The preamble was agreed to.<BR>
  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:
</P>

<PRE>
                              S. Res. 155

       Whereas April 6 has a special significance for all 
     Americans, and especially those Americans of Scottish 
     descent, because the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish 
     Declaration of Independence, was signed on April 6, 1320 and 
     the American Declaration of Independence was modeled on that 
     inspirational document;
       Whereas this resolution honors the major role that Scottish 
     Americans played in the founding of this Nation, such as the 
     fact that almost half of the signers of the Declaration of 
     Independence were of Scottish descent, the Governors in 9 of 
     the original 13 States were of Scottish ancestry, Scottish 
     Americans successfully helped shape this country in its 
     formative years and guide this Nation through its most 
     troubled times;
       Whereas this resolution recognizes the monumental 
     achievements and invaluable contributions made by Scottish 
     Americans that have led to America's preeminence in the 
     fields of science, technology, medicine, government, 
     politics, economics, architecture, literature, media, and 
     visual and performing arts;
       Whereas this resolution commends the more than 200 
     organizations throughout the United States that honor 
     Scottish heritage, tradition, and culture, representing the 
     hundreds of thousands of Americans of Scottish descent, 
     residing in every State, who already have made the observance 
     of Tartan Day on April 6 a success; and
       Whereas these numerous individuals, clans, societies, 
     clubs, and fraternal organizations do not let the great 
     contributions of the Scottish people go unnoticed: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate designates April 6 of each year 
     as "National Tartan Day."
