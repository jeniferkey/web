<CAPTION><B>IV. REBUTTAL CRITERION</B></CAPTION>
<TR><TD colspan=2>
  The Rebuttal Criterion--usually the part most overlooked in discussions of
  issues--is the requirement that an argument demonstrate that it has examined
  all the relevant, acceptable, and sufficient evidence, not just that which
  tends to support the arguer's conclusion.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD colspan=2> </TD></TR>

<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER><P><B>A. Fallacies of Counterevidence</B></P></CENTER>
  Fallacies of counterevidence are parts of arguments which ignore, dismiss,
  or deny outright a counterargument.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD WIDTH="50%">
<B>1. Ignoring the Counterevidence</B>
<P>(Assertion which simply ignores
any evidence not supporting the arguer's pre-decided conclusion)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"Federal arts funding wastes tax money on bad--even obscene--art and
     on an inefficient bureaucracy; you can't convince me that there's
     anything good about such funding at all."</P>
   <P>"God said it; I believe it; that settles it."</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>2. Denying the Counterevidence</B>
<P>(Assertion which recognizes the
existence of evidence supporting an alternative explanation, but
which tries to "explain it away" or otherwise deny it instead of
adapting one's position to it)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"You can talk about 'free markets' all you want; I just know that
     a really smart person running the economy is better than letting
     everything happen by accident."</P>
   <P>"Well, yes, it's true that we don't get anything back from all the
     tax money we send to developing nations . . . but we should feel
     good about helping other people."</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR><TD colspan=2> </TD></TR>

<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER><P><B>B. <EM>Ad Hominem</EM> Fallacies</B></P></CENTER>
  Fallacies of the <EM>ad hominem</EM> ("to the person") variety are those which
  attempt to banish counterarguments by attacking the person making them
  (thus failing not only the Rebuttal Criterion but the Relevance Criterion
  as well).
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<B>1. Abusive <EM>Ad Hominem</EM></B>
<P>(Assertion which changes the
listener's focus from defending his counterargument to defending
himself personally)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"Well, of course you'd be against abortion; you're probably frigid."</P>
   <P>"Tell me, have you actually thought about this issue, or do you just
     parrot everything Rush Limbaugh and the NRA tell you to say?"</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>2. Poisoning the Well</B>
<P>(Assertion which attempts to discredit
the listener, and thus the listener's counterargument)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"You can't know what it's like to be a woman, so your opinions about
     abortion are worthless."</P>
   <P>"Your arguments in favor of privatizing the FDA are interesting, but
     you own some medical stocks, don't you?"</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>3. "You Do It, Too" Argument</B>
<P>(Assertion which attempts to
discredit the listener's counterargument by charging the listener
with hypocrisy)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"You're in no position to tell me to stop taking drugs; I saw you
     smoke a joint once."</P>
   <P>"OK, so we took a bunch of campaign money from foreign agents and
      religious groups in return for White House access.  But look what
      the other guys did!"</P>
</TD>

<TR><TD colspan=2> </TD></TR>

<TR><TD colspan=2><CENTER><P><B>C. Fallacies of Diversion</B></P></CENTER>
  Diversive fallacies are forms of hand-waving intended to distract
  listeners from the weakness of one's own arguments or the strength of
  counterarguments.
</TD></TR>

<TR>
<TD>
<B>1. Attacking a Straw Man</B>
<P>(Assertion against an easy-to-dismiss counterargument the listener never
made)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"In other words, your support for nuclear power actually means you
     favor letting more people die of cancer."</P>
   <P>"I don't know why you're for tax cuts, unless you think the rich have
     it too tough in this country.  Why does your policy call for helping
     the rich get richer?"</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>2. Trivial Objections</B>
<P>(Assertion against the weakest parts of a listener's counterargument)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"So what if there's an ozone hole at the South Pole?  Nobody lives
     there."</P>
   <P>"I couldn't be a Catholic.  Do those people really think the Pope is
     infallible?"</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>3. Red Herring</B>
<P>(Assertion which tries to hide the weakness of a
position by drawing attention to some side issue)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"Oh, cheer up.  Things could be worse--you could be unemployed."</P>
   <P>"You're against abortion?  Well, what about legalizing marijuana, are
     you against that, too?"</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>4. Resort to Humor or Ridicule</B>
<P>(Assertion used to avoid having to directly address a counterargument)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"What's the big deal about taking life?  Take my life--please!"</P>
   <P>"Oh, so you think the Supreme Court was wrong, huh?  Gee, I didn't
     realize we had an expert on the Constitution among us.  So how
     much do you pay your law clerks, Your Eminence?"</P>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<B>5. Taking It Personally</B>
<P>(Assertion that a strong but objective counterargument is a personal
attack)</P>
</TD>
<TD>
   <P>"Every time I express how I feel, you jump on me!"</P>
   <P>"Why are you always picking on me?"</P>
