<H3>INTP -- The Architect [Designer]</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  As it is for the INTJ, the world for the INTP exists to be
understood. But while the INTJ is satisfied by knowing the rules, the
INTP insists on asking: Why those particular rules and not others?  How
do those rules interrelate?  What would an overall model of the rules
look like?  The key interest of the INTP is "design."
<P>
  Although INTPs sometimes do become actual architects, their interest
in design is much more general; they are the architects of systems.  Not
just physical systems, but also systems of knowledge and human systems.
<P>
  INTPs are the supreme logicians.  None of the other types surpasses
the INTP in detecting contradictions or errors of logic, or in their
ability to concentrate on the system currently under examination.  INTPs
constantly maintain models of systems in their minds, so any statement
which violates the rules of those systems stands out to an INTP like a
bonfire.  Even the games they play tend to demonstrate this
characteristic; INTPs are fond of puns, one-liners, and quick verbal
quips that reflect the INTP's mastery of the system called language.
<P>
  This attention to consistency sometimes brands them among other types
as "nit-pickers" and "anal-retentives."  They can also come across as
gruff, argumentative and intimidating, or aloof, arrogant and impatient,
although they it may surprise them to learn that others can perceive
them in these ways.  (In their minds they are simply being efficient,
and being courteous to others by presuming that they are intellectually
competent.)  Even when an INTP's feeling preference is somewhat better
developed, other types often find the INTP difficult to get to know.
<P>
  But once an INTP establishes a relationship, he or she will generally
appreciate it.  INTPs do have a bad habit of presuming that the other
person "knows" how the INTP feels.  Because INTPs believe that they will
offend if they repeat themselves, they often feel that "saying something
once is enough," with the result that friends and loved ones can feel
taken for granted.  In addition, the independent-mindedness and highly
focused concentration of INTPs often lead them to forget external
commitments such as anniversaries, and to put off performing routine
tasks.
<P>
  INTPs who are able to indulge their systems-building gifts are usually
content to create their designs; only rarely are they interested in
developing these designs into real-world objects.  In many cases their
work either vanishes or is ignored, or else it is developed by someone
else who reaps the financial and other rewards.
