<H3>Overview</H3>

<BR><BR>
<P>
Some people are driven to become writers because they have in them
stories which must be told.  Some people become writers because they
have general creative urges which go unsatisfied by home life or office
work.
<P>
I think those things would be nice.  But mostly I just want to get paid
to stay up late and sleep late.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>My Views</H3>

<BR>
<P>
I'm still working on my chops, but in one sense I've been "writing" now
for several years, and that is in on-line opinionizing.
<P>
As a patron of multiple-user computer systems since 1981, I've been
involved in a lot of conversations on a lot of topics.  One of the
results of this is that I've learned how to argue.  By this I don't mean
"yell a lot."  I mean "argue" in the sense of a logical argument: a
series of facts connected by logic leading to a conclusion.
<P>
Being involved in an on-line discussion is somewhat like discussing
subjects in person, but in certain ways it's both easier and more
difficult.  The primary difference is that having a day or two to
research and develop a good response to someone else's argument allows
you to put together a very strong counterargument.  In a heated debate
it's possible to get flustered and fail to make your point simply due to
your presentation; it's easier in written form to make a good point.
<P>
The thing is, the same holds true for the other persons involved in the
discussion.  They've got time to strengthen their arguments as well.  So
you actually have to work harder to support your case when you're
discussing some subject in an on-line message forum.  You have to
research your position, develop and test the logic, and present the
entire argument in the strongest form possible.  You want to be
complete, so that your argument rebuts the strongest arguments on the
other side... but you also want to be as brief and direct as possible so
that your argument is clear and forceful.
<P>
Given that there is <I>always</I> someone who is better than you at
developing such arguments, this can be a hard school.  You either learn
that you don't have the instinct to go for the jugular vein of a faulty
argument, or else that you do.  Either revelation can be sobering.
<P>
For those who find that they have this killer instinct, such discussions
are a great way to sharpen the mind.  Working out and presenting a sound
argument not only helps you to figure out what you think about a tough
issue and why you think it, it's good practice for dealing with more
personal questions.  The same habits which allow you to reach trustable
conclusions on general issues apply to thinking about your own problems.
</P>

<P>
Here is some information on the suggested form of a good argument... and
some good examples of bad arguments.  If you're tired of getting hammered
by "clever" debaters who won't address your points, this essay
<A HREF="discuss.htm">On Discussion</A> is for you.
</P>

<BR>
<P>
And here are some typical arguments I've made during the past few
years.  If you decide to examine them, try to put aside whether or not
you agree with the conclusion--think about whether the argument is
presented well, and if it follows the advice given in <I>The Elements of
a Sound Argument</I>.
<P>
<EM>Then</EM> feel free to take your whacks at the underlying ideas.
<P>
A note on these arguments: Most of them (as you'll see) were made as
part of a conversation between myself and someone else.  So first, let
me say "thank you" to those who took the time to discuss issues with
me.  While it was always nice when people agreed with me, I learned
more from those who disagreed with me.  What's more, these persons
helped me by forcing me to confront my beliefs, to examine them
closely, and to try to express my conclusions with precision and
clarity.
<P>
I modified only slightly the text of these discussions from their
original forms.  This consists primarily of deleting the names of my
correspondents to respect their privacy.  Other than that, I have made
only simple editorial revisions for spelling and grammar, and added
HTML formatting elements for clarity.
<P>
Speaking of HTML formatting, a word about the form of these
documents is in order.  Usually these conversations were a
back-and-forth dialogue (that's sort of the definition of the word
"dialogue," isn't it? a back-and-forth between two speakers).  In such
discussions, it's often useful to quote part of the other person's
argument to them in order to address it.
<P>
Some of the documents that follow contain such quotes.  I've used HTML
to format them like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>My original argument, which they quoted for me</B>
<P>
  <I>Their counter-argument, which I quoted for them</I>
<P>
  My new argument
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Also, the HTML "horizontal rule" (an example of which follows this
sentence) is used to separate different individual pieces of
correspondence in the same conversation thread.
