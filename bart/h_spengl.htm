<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
Oswald Spengler expressed a decidedly cyclical view of human history
in his controversial work, <I>The Decline of the West</I>.  I'm not
going to try to review that entire work; what matters to this
discussion is Spengler's notion that human societies were functionally
similar to both terrestrial seasons and the human lifespan.
</P>

<BR>
<H2>The Biological Metaphor</H2>

<P>
Both of these processes seemed to Spengler (and, it should be noted,
plenty of other historians) to be composed of specific kinds of events
in a definite sequence.  In terms of life: youth, maturity, decline,
and death; in terms of seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter.  The
biological pattern is persuasive as a metaphor for existence: new life comes into
being; it matures into fullness and settles into a preferred form; it
conserves its resources by refining the chosen form to its highest
level; and it grows weak and dies.
<P>
Spengler adapted this biological metaphor to describe civilizations.  First, a
culture is born out of a critical mass of sufficiently similar-minded
individuals.  This culture "wins" over other nearby challengers for
local resources; when this happens, the social customs and innovations
developed to promote survival crystallize into institutions.  At this
point, the culture becomes a "civilization."  It then spends the next
phase of its existence refining its habits without really changing them;
merely doing the same old things better.  Finally, no longer able to
respond to an environment that has continued to change, it disintegrates
and its remaining resources are absorbed by new cultures.
</P>

<BR>
<H2>The End of the Road</H2>

<P>
For all its limitations as an explanation for why civilizations perish,
there is something appealing about this model of what has come to be
known as "cultural morphology," or the forms civilizations take. Perhaps
we find this explanation so plausible for the same reason our model of
the solar system looked the way it did for so long: we like to think of
ourselves at the center of the universe.  "The proper measure of
everything is Man," to paraphrase an old saying.
<P>
But this may be mere vanity.  Not only is it perhaps <EM>too</EM>
appealing, it leads to intense pessimism because it implies that
civilizations, like life, are doomed to eventual extinction no matter
what their worth might be.  If the end of all effort is extinction, the
study of history is worthless--after all, the point of studying history
is to learn what directions lead nowhere.  But why bother, if all roads
are dead ends?
</P>

<BR>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
Even the title of Spengler's opus insinuated that Western civilization
was already descending toward an inevitable demise.  It is a
testament to the power of Spengler's expression of this view that
universities today are filled with academics--historians and
otherwise--who echo the Spenglerian lament of hopelessness with
pessimism, cynicism, and anomie.
</P>

<BR>
<H2>The Chart</H2>

<P>
Over a period of fifteen years, the British science fiction author James
Blish wrote a series of four novels which were published together in the
omnibus volumed titled "Cities in Flight." These works, which chronicled
some 2000 years of future human history, were to some degree inspired by
concepts found in Oswald Spengler's <I>The Decline of the West</I>.
<P>
Around 1968, the <I>Riverside Quarterly</I> published an analysis by Dr.
Richard D. Mullen of the Spenglerian aspects of Blish's "Cities in
Flight" novels. In his analysis, Dr. Mullen included a chart he derived
from Spengler. This chart provides an excellent at-a-glance comparison
of three civilizations (and Blish's imaginary future civilization). I
have adapted elements of that chart, which you can see below.
