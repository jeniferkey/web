<H3>Overview</H3>

<BR>
<P>
It seems as though irrationality is spreading like a crippling,
infectious disease through Western civilization.  The late Professor
Quigley of Georgetown University may have considered this a purely
natural stage in the progression of a civilization, but I am inclined
to the opinion that it is not inevitable.
<P>
The antidote is to return to teaching science as the great adventure
it truly is.
</P>

<BR>
<H3>My Views</H3>

<BR>
<P>
Did your Science class always put you to sleep after lunch in school?
<P>
Then you had a bad teacher!
<P>
On the contrary, science can be exciting, and it ought to be taught by
people who understand that.  After ages of darkness and superstition
and sheer guesswork that killed as often as it enlightened, we slowly
and painfully developed a means by which the physical secrets of the
entire universe can be unlocked: a cosmic key.
<P>
Do you remember how you felt when you learned to drive and got your
own car?  Do you recall the rush at realizing the opportunities that
suddenly opened up for you?  That is what discovering the scientific
method is like for someone inclined to ask why reality works the way
it does.  It's like being given a key to a chest that contains every
amazing thing in the world.  It's even better than discovering cool
things--it's discovering <EM>why</EM> they're cool.
<P>
Someone asked me recently: "Given what I know about Scientific Studies
in general, it isn't all that unusual for research and/or organized
studies to prove the original theory, right? And then another study
comes out disproving the exact same data?"
<P>
This is a good question because it helps to pinpoint the central
insight of the scientific method.
<P>
It's this: Science is an approximation to Truth.  Humans are fallible
creatures; we make mistakes.  And we're limited creatures; even if we
made no mistakes, we still couldn't know enough to understand
everything perfectly.  Therefore it just isn't possible for any of us
to ever hope to understand any phenomenon completely, all the way to
the level of perfect Truth.
<P>
The best we can do is approximate it.  We can't hit 100 percent, but
we can try to come as close as possible.  And that's what science
permits through the application of what is known as the scientific
method.  No experiment ever "proves" anything, not in the sense of
perfect proof.  (Quick definitions--an "experiment" is the testing of
a hypothesis, and a "hypothesis" is a statement about cause and
effect: "Mechanism A is responsible when doing X makes Y happen.")
<P>
What a proper experiment does do is provide evidence that a proposed
cause-and-effect relationship may exist.  If the experiment actually
does test the hypothesis expressed (which isn't always the case),
then a successful outcome is not absolute proof, but it is what's
called a "confirming instance"--an example that, sure enough, after
doing X where mechanism A was solely involved, Y happened.
<P>
And what the scientific method tells us is that, if when you do an
experiment the predicted result happens... and when *I* repeat that
experiment and the same thing happens... and when Professor Gdsnrjx
in Gdansk gets the same result... and so on for anyone who repeats
the experiment... then the summation of all those confirming
instances adds up to what's called a "preponderance of the
evidence."  In other words, the likelihood that a glimmering of
Truth has been correctly identified, because anybody who performs
the same experiment gets the same result.  And that only works if
objective reality is in fact independent of subjective belief.
<P>
Scientists live to demonstrate that.
<P>
We can never be entirely sure of the cause-and-effect mechanism we
think we've isolated; we can never reach 100 percent.  But often
enough we can come close enough to 100 percent that, on a practical
level (the level of engineering), we can accomplish wonders.
<P>
Now, back to the popular notion of "proving" and "disproving."  The
reason why scientists sometimes reach different conclusions is
because their hypotheses are not falsifiable (a term used by Karl
Popper).  Instead of saying, "Only when I remove all possibility of
Mechanism A occurring will doing X fail to make Y happen," too many
scientists say, "Doing X makes Y happen."
<P>
Obviously, the latter approach is a lot simpler.  Scientists are
people, too; sometimes they choose the easy road.  Where this
becomes a problem is when multiple mechanisms are required to
produce an observed result.  Sure, mechanism A might be necessary
for doing X to make Y happen... but maybe mechanism B is necessary,
too.  (For example, most plants need sunlight to grow, but they
also need water.)
<P>
Let's say you run an experiment where both mechanisms A and B are
present.  You do X, and sure enough, Y happens.  But when Professor
Billy-Bob down the road tries to run that same experiment,
mechanism A is present but B (for whatever reason) isn't.  When
the good Professor does X, Y won't happen.
<P>
Because the hypothesis wasn't falsifiable--because it didn't isolate a
lone mechanism to test--scientists who appear to be duplicating each
other's experiments can wind up getting different results.  Because
instead of (as Sherlock Holmes once sort of put it) "eliminating the
impossible" these scientists tried to shortcut all the way to
identifying the relevant mechanism in one fell swoop, they get
inconsistent results.
<P>
Then we in the public get to listen to them squabble like spoiled
brats.  (If you're not recalling the sound and fury over "cold
fusion" right now, you should be.)
<P>
What, then, is a person to think when reasonable-sounding evidence
is presented from some apparently reputable person or group which
calls into question or claims to disprove an established idea?  Or
some other alternative is presented, with "scientific facts" to back
its claims?
<P>
There are a couple of factors at work here.  First and foremost is that
"preponderance of the evidence" thing.  Whatever you might prefer to
believe one way or the other, if the preponderance of the evidence
lies on one side, then you can say <EM>tentatively</EM> that that's the
explanation of reality most likely to be correct.  It may, in fact,
not be correct.  But when the available data are few, then it's the
best option until more and better data come along.
<P>
By contrast, if there's a preponderance of evidence supporting a
particular claim, then you don't need to be so tentative.  You still
need to remember that absolute truth is impossible.  That claim might
still be wrong.  But a preponderance of evidence means that the odds
of error are low; it's OK to go ahead and conduct your life as though
that claim was proven.  Just be willing to consider new evidence if
it comes along.
<P>
The other factor concerning conflicting claims is trustability.  Most
serious science goes through what's called "peer review."  This
consists of a scientist's forming a falsifiable hypothesis; performing
an experiment (or several) which try but fail to disprove that
hypothesis; writing up a scholarly article on the research findings;
and then allowing that scientist's peers (by which is meant other
scientists in the same field, some of whom may hate the first
scientist's guts) to try in every way their devious little minds can
dream up to show how what the first scientist did was 1) a fluke, 2)
bad science, or 3) attributable to some other factor.  If the
objections and jealous whining of the author's peers aren't sufficiently
convincing to the editor of the prestigious science journal to which
the article was submitted, and the article fits editorial requirements,
then it gets published.
<P>
Most science that survives this bruising process is generally (though
not always) fairly trustable.  Far more so than, say, findings of
"telepathy" that are published only in "parapsychology" journals, which
don't apply the full-blown general-science peer review process.
<P>
So does all this mean you should trust the folks in the lab coats with
all you hold dear?
<P>
No.  You should always maintain a fair but principled skepticism about
all claims, including scientific claims.  Again, scientists are human;
not only can they be swayed by political considerations (as in the
disputed claim of "global warming"), they're fallible.  They can screw
up just like the rest of us.
<P>
But, ultimately, just because you can't always trust scientists to be
right doesn't mean that the <EM>scientific process itself</EM> is
flawed.  Disagreement among scientists may seem to mean that it's unsafe
to believe anything they say.  But in fact, it is that very disagreement
that makes science healthy and causes it to deserve your respect at the
least.
<P>
Because if you can get a bunch of objective but egotistical scientists
to agree on something, you probably won't go wrong accepting their
conclusion.  They may still prove to be mistaken... but their insistence
on seeing reality as it actually is can only work in your favor.
