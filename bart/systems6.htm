<H4>V. SYSTEM DESIGN GUIDELINES: LONGEVITY</H4>

<BR>
<B>1. Systems develop goals of their own the instant they come into
being.</B>
<P>
The moment someone begins using a simple working system, they become
part of that system... along with their goals for this new, larger
system.
<P>
As the system grows further, becoming still more complex as more people
use it, more goals are added.  Some of these goals will be mutually
exclusive; they can't all be fully satisfied.  Eventually it becomes
impossible to explain why the system as a whole does whatever it
does.  The system appears to take on goals of its own that are
completely independent of whatever purpose the original system's
designers intended.
<P>
It's important to realize that this apparent intentionality--the
appearance of a system's having a mind, personality and will of its
own--is just that: apparent.  It's not real.  Systems with many
inter-system goals are so complicated as to seem to act almost randomly
or chaotically... but the human mind is disposed to see patterns, even
where none exist.  (Have you ever talked to your car or your computer as
though they had distinct personalities?  Why?)
<P>
This is a natural perception of systems.  At a low level, there is no
illusion of system consciousness--the system's actions are few enough
and simple enough to be comprehensible.  Only when these actions
accumulate and their macro-level effects are observed is the appearance
of conscious, intentional behavior created.
<P>
Some cognitive scientists and philosophers wonder if the same might be
true of the systems called human beings.
</P>

<BR>
<B>2. The longer a system exists, the more its primary goal becomes
self-preservation.</B>
<P>
Constituencies again.  The more people who are served by a particular
system, the greater the resistance to changing that system... and,
bizarrely, this is so <EM>whether that system works or not</EM>.
<P>
As a system grows, serving more users, adding more internal "features"
and requiring more support functions which will require support features
of their own, the entire system itself begins to act as though it has a
will to live.
<P>
Eventually--once the system has gotten very large and been around for
years--all other system goals will have been crowded out to make room
for the fundamental goal of self-preservation.  No matter how the system
or its goals are described, internally or externally, the one true goal
of the system will be to preserve its own existence.  All of that
system's functions will be bent to serve that purpose, and all resources
consumed by the system will be directed toward defending it from
external threats.
<P>
Example: An expert scientific panel found "no association" between
silicone breast implants and immune system complaints.  But the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration under David Kessler had already made its
decision to prevent women from having access to implants.  Since the
science called into question the competence of the FDA to decide for
citizens what it thinks is best for them, it became a threat to the
existence of the system.  As Kessler put it: "If members of our society
were empowered to make their own decisions about the entire range of
products for which the FDA has responsibility, then the whole rationale
for the agency would cease to exist."
</P>

<BR>
<B>3. The longer a system exists, the greater its resistance to any
fundamental change short of complete destruction.</B>
<P>
Resistance to change seems to be a natural feature of all mature
systems.  At some point, the effort required to change becomes greater
than the resources available to make that change.  (When the system
under consideration is a civilization, the historian Carroll Quigley's
terms for this are an "instrument" which becomes an "institution."  But
these terms could be applied equally well to systems in general.)
<P>
When this occurs, the system's final insulation from its environment
begins.  Soon no reality will get through to the controlling elements at
all.  The closed positive feedback loop is complete.  And the only way
the original problem will be solved is by the creation of an entirely
new, small, working system.
<P>
Example: Despite the lack of a military draft for years, the Selective
Service Agency continues to exist, requiring that young men (but not
women--where's the feminist outrage?) register for the draft, and
punishing them for failing to do so.  Even the Pentagon has said that
this registration is no longer necessary.
<P>
But to add insult to injury, in 1997 Selective Service Director Gil
Coronado began arguing that the Agency has "a natural opportunity to
promote voluntary service to America in AmeriCorps."  AmeriCorps, as
you may or may not be aware, is the "service organization" created
during the Clinton Administration.  Consisting in theory of "paid
volunteers" (an oxymoron obvious to anyone but a politician), in
practice AmeriCorps workers were highly politicized, manning phone
banks during campaigns in California and generally redistributing
tax dollars so that a few people could feel good about themselves.
<P>
Converting the no-longer-necessary Selective Service Agency into a
registration front for AmeriCorps is a prime example of how old systems
refuse to change fundamentally in response to a changing environment.
<P>
Example: Despite the fact that only one agency (NASA) has any use for
huge quantities of helium, it took the U.S. Congress decades to
privatize the national helium depository... and the last time I
checked, the federal tea-tasting board still existed.
</P>

<BR>
<B>4. Most temporary patches aren't.</B>
<P>
As any experienced software developer can tell you, the quickest way to
insure immortality for a small, working, useful program is to call it
a "prototype."  It will immediately be declared a public or corporate
resource; its future growth will be taken over by a committee; and your
name will never be seen on it again . . . unless it goes berserk and
kills someone, in which case yours will be the <EM>only</EM> name
associated with it.
