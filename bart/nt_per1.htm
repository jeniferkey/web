<H3>I. Introduction</H3>

<BR>
<P>
  This document is intended to provide a gentle introduction to the
Myers-Briggs theory of personality types.
<P>
  You may be wondering why I don't just launch into a description of the
different personality types as described by the Myers-Briggs personality
model.  Why go into all that "theoretical foundations" stuff?
<P>
  Well, it's not just because I personally prefer theory to applications
(although that is in fact true, and as you will see later is a typical
pattern for one particular personality type).  I want to talk about the
theory that underlies the portraits of the different types and
temperaments because it's the scientific basis of an independently
testable theoretical model that separates type and temperament theory
from "faith-based" systems of personality analysis such as astrology and
the enneagram.
<P>
  In other words, type and temperament theory are based on observation,
on fitting the model to the facts.  That's different--better, I would
say--from other systems which claim to describe the variations in human
behavior, in that those other systems take some part of their authority
from claims that they are based on "ancient wisdom."  "Ancient wisdom"
is always a code phrase meaning, "We can't back up with facts and
evidence the 'model' we made up, so just shut up and accept whatever we
claim."
<P>
  That's a lousy basis for any field of study.  If it yields acceptable
practical results, and it's the only thing out there, then I might be
persuaded to use it while I look for something better--i.e., something
based on science instead of superstition.  But that's not the case for
personality analysis.  In this case, we've got a model based on
observational science: Jung/Myers-Briggs/Keirsey type and temperament
theory.
<P>
  I think it's important to defend science over "because I said so."  In
this specific case, I think it's important to do more than claim that
type and temperament theory work to explain differences in personality;
I believe I need to offer some reasonably plausible hypothesis as to
_why_ these models work.  Otherwise I'm just setting myself up as an
authority for you to believe in... and that's no better than astrology.
<P>
  So I hope you'll take the time to look at my explanations of why type
and temperament theory work.  This isn't a dissertation, so don't expect
a lot of footnotes and bibliographic references, but I will try to
balance clarity of presentation with solid factual information.
<P>
  I hope you find this whole series useful.

<H3>Usage Note</H3>
It should be noted that the discussions which follow are my own
interpretations of the ideas behind this branch of personality modeling
derived from the works of Carl G. Jung.  I stand behind my comments,
but I should point out that I am not a medical doctor; nothing I say
is intended as medical advice and none of my remarks or suggestions
should be taken as medical advice.
<P>
Furthermore, nothing herein should be considered to be in any way an
"official" interpretation of Myers-Briggs personality analysis, and I
disavow any such representation of myself.  Only someone who is
trained and licensed to administer the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
&reg; test and interpret its results should be considered an "official"
source.
