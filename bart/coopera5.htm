<H3>How Tit for Tat Works</H3>

<P>Axelrod concluded that Tit for Tat succeeded not by trying to
do the absolute best for itself in every transaction, but by
trying to maximize the sum of its own and the other player's
reward in all transactions combined. In other words, Tit for Tat
did well for itself because the effect of its strategy was to
allow every player with whom it interacted to do well.
<P>
An intriguing aspect of this is found in the raw scores of the
various Prisoner's Dilemma tournaments. Looking at the numbers,
it quickly becomes obvious that in individual encounters Tit for
Tat never did better than strategies which were more
&quot;aggressive&quot; (i.e., defected more often)
or--interestingly--strategies which were more
&quot;forgiving&quot; (i.e., didn't always respond immediately to
a defection with a defection of its own). In individual
transactions, Tit for Tat's numbers were solidly
middle-of-the-road.
<P>
But over iterated transactions the consequences of defection
began to outweigh the benefits. As more players started to
resemble Tit for Tat, which always retaliated immediately to a
defection but was always open to cooperation, the long-term
payoff for defection dropped. Soon there were no players who
could be taken advantage of by a defecting strategy. Meanwhile,
the Tit for Tat-like cooperating strategies were busy
cooperating. Their long-term payoffs were never outstanding...
just better than those of the defectors.
