she's broad. Eventually we'll probably switch to the Ortho-Flex jumping,

squeeze with my legs and release the second she walks forward.</font>

swish is her saying that she's not completely happy she had to give in.</font></center>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(I tend to judge how this will go with
how they load in the trailer. She went in immediately when asked, but got
sulky if she was told to. Took a short lesson with whip tapping for her
to see that I would wait her out and irritate her until she went in. Same
thing under saddle. Now I'm a little worried about Thistle coming up, because
in his loading lesson he just stood there. Didn't acknowledge the tapping
for maybe an hour. More like Emma, and might have to start under saddle
on the lunge to really get the forward idea...).</font></center>
