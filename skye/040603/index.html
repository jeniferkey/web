She said that the worst thing Skye would do is ignore her aids. I think
some of that was getting used to each other. Lydia said the first time
she asked for the trot, Skye hesitated, but moved into the trot and figured
out how to balance with her rider. Much more willing than Emma, who needed
someone on the ground with a lunge whip, for encouragement.</font></center>
