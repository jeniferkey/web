with the Hunt</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's not easy to get pictures out roading
(exercising the hounds),</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but Bart took a stab at it last weekend.
There are more pictures</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at <a href="http://www.hickorycreekhunt.com/040724road/">http://www.hickorycreekhunt.com/040724road/</a>
(some duplicates).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Driving over, I thought Skye and I would
be all alone. A first, so I was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">quite nervous. Then I pulled up and there
were three other horses there,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">also a first, so I remained nervous. She
neighed once to the other horses,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and while she was tied, she turned her
head a lot to see all her new friends.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I saddled her and led her around while
everyone else mounted up. She</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">seemed happy, but not too concerned, so
up I got.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She rode just fine. Occasionally, when
passing another horse, she'd slow up</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a bit, but when I asked her to trot on
or stop and let someone pass, she responded</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">nicely. A hot day, and we went out twice,
but a great training session.</font></center>

She has a smooth trot, and actually a nice little jog if we need to keep
up with long legged horses walking out.</font></center>
