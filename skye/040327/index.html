<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>&nbsp;</b>So, this is the fourth time
I've been up on Skye. The</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">first time was back in December, being
led a few steps</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by my trainer. The second time my father
led us around.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last weekend I had him unhook the lead,
but she didn't want</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to leave his side. Today, she understood
the forward cue, and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">calmly stepped off every time I asked
her to.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was almost in the English saddle this
ride, but the Western makes me</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">feel I can deal with anything she might
do. I don't really trust until the 10th</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">or so ride, and then it still depends
on the horse.</font>
