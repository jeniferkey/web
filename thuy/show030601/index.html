<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Combined Test on
Thuy - Sidesaddle</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Well, Thuy was having a
bad day. His dressage warm up was chargy,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>to say the least, and his
Training 1 test was horrid.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He decided to be worried
about Bob, his trailer-mate, and seemed</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>to use that excuse to shy
at things and ignore me.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He's been to these show
grounds many times before, but today we had canter departs that were close
to bolts,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and leaps across the arena
at every gait but the walk. At least the judge complimented my riding by
putting</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>down 'Good Control!'</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I figure yesterday's ride
was a good precursor to Fox Hunting. We had sudden leaps to the left and
right,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and being sidesaddle made
no difference to how I controlled him and made him at least simulate the</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>dressage pattern. During
one canter/gallop circle, I was able to think 'drop him, pick him back
up, and</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>get that trot before we
hit b'. It wasn't pretty, but we did get a round of applause when I saluted.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I decided to scratch our
BN CT entry, but I schooled the Intro jumps in warm up, and decided to
do a non-judged</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>round over the Intro course.
Thuy was absolutely perfect, no refusals, he trotted the fences I asked
him to, and cantered</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>those that I wanted to.
He didn't even pull toward Bob. I guess he thought two dressage shows in
a week was just too much.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One person said he went
into the dressage ring like he was looking for the hounds...</font></font></center>
