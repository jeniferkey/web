<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An unbelievable day for Thuy and me.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I don't get to ride much in my sidesaddle,
so with everyone's approval,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I got together everything I'd need to
enter the turn out phase aside.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was all for fun, and to show more
people my adorable Thuy horse.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was lucky enough to have Chrissie groom
for me and Thuy's turnout was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">impeccable. With equipment borrowed from
Laura, Gabrielle, Mary Ann and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">others (mum made the sandwiches), we were
ready for Thuy to show his cuteness.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He did impress the judges, and we won the
turn out phase. That phase</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">did not affect the scoring for the rest
of the day, but it was delightful to win.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the first persons I called with
my results was my trainer of 20 or so years.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I can remember her trying to get me to
brush the mud off my horse before</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">entering the ring for a class. Or just
trying to get me to wipe down a saddle.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With that over, we had a quick tack and
attire change, and went in for the</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hack phase. We showed the judges walk,
trot and canter both directions. They</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">judged in two groups, and then pulled
from both groups for a final cut. Yippee, we</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">made the cut and Thuy got to show off
his gallop for the crowd (I heard cheering as</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we flew by).</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There was a small break to prepare for
the mock hunt, and then we headed out. It</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">got in the 90s and I was tiring quickly.
But, the mock hunt was so much fun that there</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">wasn't time to think about being hot and
tired. We dashed through the woods and over</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">jumps and had checks and got out of the
way of the judges vehicle and continued on.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thuy and I enjoyed ourselves immensely,
although there were times when he wished</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'd have let him charge at the fences
a little faster. It was a group of 20. We've never hunted</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">up front with that many, and we were in
the middle, so I made him be careful at the fences.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Back at the trailers we had a break to
cool ourselves and the horses down. Thuy was dry by time</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we got to the trailer, but he got a nice
hose down and was happy to munch on a bag of hay. Jake</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">has worked with Thuy quite a bit, and
he was on hand to untack and water when I needed a break.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The final phase was a handy hunter course.
There was a bridge and gate and, of course, jumps.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was ready for everything to be over,
but once we started around the course Thuy's enthusiasm</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was contagious and I had fun running around
the jumps. Thuy opened the gate with his head,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">which got a laugh from the crowd. He definitely
was hamming it up.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the final awards I received my ribbon
for turnout, Othello and David, another member of Hickory</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Creek came in 8th, and they announced
that Thuy and I were 4th. The top 4 places are qualified</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for the finals in VA in May. After all
the preparation for this, I can't believe how it'd be in VA. But,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'm starting to figure out the logistics.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
