<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Thuy schooling/showing
the Novice course at Curragh</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We went into this weekend thinking it
was all for fun. And boy did we have fun!</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We schooled all the Novice fences, and
the training bank and water</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">complexes. The day of the event our dressage
was acceptable (39), especially</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">considering he's had a dressage saddle
on once in the last six months (this past Wednesday).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was very worried about stadium because
we didn't get to school it the day before, and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it was in the inside dressage arena, and
it had an in and out (which we've never</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">done at the novice level). Anyway, my
being so silly, he thought the course was great</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and just attacked the fences. I, on the
other hand, focused too much on the in and out, and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">when we successfully negotiated it, forgot
to take fence number six which came next.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I did a circle and took it before number
seven, but had penalties because of it.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then, after a clear cross country, I had
20 penalties for time. At least, I thought it was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">time penalties. I went and checked, and
it was actually speed penalties. We'd gone</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a minute and 5 seconds too fast. This
on the little guy who had trouble making time</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Beginner Novice. I was actually quite
pleased. Now I know we can definitely make</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">time at Novice, and probably even at Training
if we ever want to try that.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What's a little strange, is that for timid
me (who's been known to trot a horse so slowly</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to a cross country fence that the horse
couldn't jump it), a minute under time felt</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">very comfortable. I sat up for every fence,
but otherwise I only really asked for a gallop</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">between two fences where I knew we'd have
a lot of space. I slowed to a canter for the water</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">jump, but I do remember coming off the
last jump heading for home and not being</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">able to see because of the tears in my
eyes. Fox hunting has done a lot for both of us.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Definitely a fun weekend!</font></center>
