this morning. He has some of&nbsp; that stubborn pony streak in him. Luckily
stubborn is what I do best. He's more reactive than Thuy (which can be
nice), and his reaction so far has been to move in some direction (even
if it's not the correct one). It's never been to rear or buck or leave
the situation. This makes working with him just a patience game, and not
a fight. That I Iike.</font>

and kind words as praise. Another thing I like...</font></center>
