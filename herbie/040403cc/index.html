Cross Country</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It's been a busy week with a jumping lesson
on Thursday,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the cross country school on Saturday and
the Dressage show</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">on Sunday. Herbie was a champ til the
end. Always loading and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">unloading, even in the dark, and showing
a lot of patience waiting</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">for other riders to be ready, and other
horses to be finished.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This time out, we had to leave at a certain
time, and our group decided to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">stay longer. Herbie and I had to leave
the group for a long trek back to the trailers</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">alone. He neighed once, but never tried
to turn back. He was willing to walk or</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">trot up the trail and past the scary machinery.
I was carrying my husband's</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Digital Camera, and told Herbie that if
I had to choose, I'd have to pick the camera...</font></center>
