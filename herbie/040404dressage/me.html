Dressage</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I took Herbie in Intro 2 and Training
1.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had some trouble with our canter transitions.
After</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3 weeks of practice, we still run into
the gait. It's better</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at home, so I know we'll have it down
pretty quickly.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My husband commented that it was funny
that Herbie</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">got the highest and lowest scores of all
my tests for the day.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He got a 65.7% for the intro and a 54.5%
for the training.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A couple of 4s on transitions will bump
you down...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So, besides his 3rd for Lydia, we got
a 3rd and 6th place.</font>

that's nice, is when you are doing a figure in a test, you can control
every step and have a lot of time to make the figure accurate. Of course
that can work against you. Because it's pretty obvious, as the pony is
taking his time crossing the diagonal, if he's leaning against your right
leg and drifting toward his friend standing outside the arena...</font></center>
