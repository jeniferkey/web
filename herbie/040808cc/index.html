<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We've been having some great weather and
this past weekend</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">was no exception. Skye got to whip in
out roading, and Herbie</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">went to Greenwood for some schooling.
We only had trouble at one</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">jump. He refused a couple of times, then
went over a couple of times.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I think it was asking a bit much, because
it was a couple of strides after</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">going through the water. I think he focused
on the water, then came out</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and said wait a minute, there's not enough
time to think about the jump...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Otherwise, he jumped everything I asked
him to. He went through the water</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">first try, and we got to play with banks,
which we hadn't done before.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had a fun time, and I think he developed
a lot more confidence, because</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by the last jump he was jumping out of
stride and was very relaxed about it.</font></center>
