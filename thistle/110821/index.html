Today was canter transitions. I had to go to the whip, but then we had nice transitions
    <br />both directions and we had some lovely balanced canter work 
    <br />
    (once I quit whining about the heat and kept my position through the downward).<br />
    He has his first dressge show this weekend.<br />No real stretch for the walk or trot, but he can march out at the walk and stay balanced at the trot<br />which is
better than a lot of my horses for their first training level test.</font>

    He's a very different ride than Miaren. I wasn't as upright on him. My trainer worked
    to get my leg placement right. A chair seat felt right, so she was asking for me
    to keep my leg underneath me. But, then I'd get it too far back.</div>

    He didn't start out completely through, but he was engaging his stomach muscles
      and it wasn't very long before he was lifting through his back.<br />

    Not what I wanted at the moment, but close to what I'll want for the stretchy trot
    circle, so I try to encourage forward instead of picking his head back up.</div>

      I did say try. He'll let me shorten my reins too much without a lot of complaint.
      Luckily I have a trainer on the ground who tells me to give him back a couple of
      inches while we work to length his stride and not shorten it.<br />

      Leg yielding along the 'wall'. Got it from the clinic I did. After a couple of months
      Miaren and I still aren't always in sync. Thistle learned it after the first couple
      tries and now I just have to remind him to go with my rhythm and not his own.<br />

      He got a little sulky when I didn't let him get his way. He feels very powerful,
      but in our lessons he doesn't make me nervous.<br />

    <div class="left">

        He's already forgotten there was a discussion and is starting to relax into a longer
        stride.</div>

      Change of direction through the circle is a bit of work for me. From hunting he
      doesn't see a reason to stay nicely balanced and soft through the turns. I have
      to remind him almost every stride that it's not just about getting some place, but
      how we are getting there.<br />

        Bart did a sequence of pictures going to the right. I'm sure Thistle is wondering
        where the gate is.</div>

        Not sure what he's having an opinion about, but that nose going out usually means
        something.</div>

      My position is better on Miaren, but seeing these pictures should help me improve
      on Thistle. Stupid heels (and back, and upper leg and arms). At least I'm not looking
      down, that would have made it complete.<br />

        We love his downward to the walk. I guess following hounds you just keep marching.</div>

      He doesn't seem to easily stretch down at the walk, but he's starting to consider
      it.<br />

        I find it interesting that with a little dressage work he can start to look trimmer
        (for him). I guess there will always be that neck, though.</div>

      Got too dark for canter pictures. The flash does weird things to his eyes. Almost
      taking after his father's side and looking like a giant Welsh pony.<br />
