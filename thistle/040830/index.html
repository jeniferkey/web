Training</font></font></b>

<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now that Skye and Herbie are gone, Thuy
and Thistle have</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">come out to my place.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thistle is two this year, and he needs
to start learning a work ethic.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Every time I handle him, he seems to give
in to my requests faster and faster.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Last weekend, when I was picking up Thuy,
I gave Thistle a refresher course</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">in trailer loading. It took us an hour,
but in the end he got on and off 4 or 5 times</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">without a fuss ( he just had to learn
to respond to the request for forward).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This weekend, when I went to pick him
up, once we got to the trailer,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">he walked on immediately like he did it
every day.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Getting to the trailer and leaving the
pasture was another matter, but after one little</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">temper tantrum, he gave in completely
and went like an adult horse.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'm sure there will be fewer and fewer
tantrums once he sees that I am more stubborn and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that it's easier to do what I want than
go through fighting it. I also think that he will learn that</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">he can trust me, which will go a long
way when introducing him to new situations.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Quite a difference from Skye, but I have
a feeling that once he does something, it'll be</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">because of obedience and not just being
nice (which I tend to like better, because I think</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it's more reliable - of course I could
be wrong, and I'll get to see how it goes).</font>
