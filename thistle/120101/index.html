He was more fun than I expected, so I whipped in on him when the season started.
    <br />We went out paired up with other riders, but Thistle was happy to head out on our own when needed.

        Fall hunting. Amanda has ridden Thistle around at the house, but they don't know
        each other well enough for her to take him out in the field.</div>

      The huntsman took out my Thuy this hunt. Thistle neighed a few times to his trailer-mate,
      but he didn't get silly when they'd go off with the hounds.</div>

      Getting the gate for the other riders. We're working through that he's right handed
      and I'm left handed when it comes to gates. If I need it fast we do right handed,
      if I want to prove a point, I asked him to do it left handed.</div>

      Thistle has the best walk of all my hunt horses. He can get sluggish if we aren't necessarily heading the direction he thinks we should be going, though.</div>

        Heading out to the East. I wondered how Thistle'd be with other horses since he
        was used to being left alone as the hunstman's horse. He seems just fine leading
        or following with others.</div>

      I took my Miaren horse on a hunt trail ride once this seaon. It was strange to see how much they notice or what bothers them when they've never been out. Standing
      on the trail waiting for a gate seems a given with a horse like Thistle. Miaren
      had to figure out the concept.</div>
