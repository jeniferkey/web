weekend.</font>

He really powers</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">forward. She worked a little on softening
(which he</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">either ignored or obliged-no fighting)
and more on</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">going where she wanted (that brought out
a bit more fight).</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He was very good about giving her
a good walk. Watching her ride, it was difficult to tell that she was asking
him to soften. He didn't fuss when she asked, he just ignored her. Reminds
me of the time I taught him to load in the trailer. He's a very patient
horse (or is that stubborn).</font></center>

ride should be done and would pop his shoulder as they went around the
corner and leave the arena and go sideways ignoring the rein.</font>

him go past the same corner. He'd be silly again and again.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After a little pitter patter temper tantrum
with his front feet, which she ignored, they came back up, made the corner
and he did what she asked like he'd never been a bad pony. Reminds me of
Thuy....</font></center>
