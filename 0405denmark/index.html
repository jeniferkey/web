a neat little island. Now they're in a lovely modern house. Quite a difference,
but at least Torben still gets to visit his horses.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To get to their house I caught a train
from Copenhagen that went to Kobe. I was so proud to use my credit card
in the ticket machine. I took the paper that came out (couldn't read it,
it was in Danish) and got on the train. After we started moving the ticket
person came by and I gave him the paper. He asked "where was my ticket".
I told him that's what I got out of the machine. He read it closely and
said that it said that my credit card didn't work and I should have tried
the machine again. So, I was stuck and not sure what to do. There's a hefty
fine for no ticket, but he saw I was horrified, and let it slide. Nice
Danish train people...</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Oh, and from then on, when I was getting
on a train, I found the ticket person before it started off, and confirmed
that I had the right ticket and train. One time, going back home from Copenhagen,
the ticket person said it was a good ticket, but we'd better move to a
different car. Because the car we were in would separate from the train
and not end up at the town we needed to go to. No stress on this vacation...</font></center>

I wanted to visit. Since we were going to Copenhagen for a seminar for
Bart, Far suggested we stop off at Tivoli that evening and walk around
and have a nice dinner.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I chose a place called Nimb (because they
offered Creme Brule) and we had an awesome and expensive three course meal.
Great food, but one little bottle of water cost us $5. Afterwards we decided
to head home, because it was a holiday Friday and there was a concert about
to happen. The place was packed, and it was difficult to just walk out
and find the exits. Really a beautiful place to look at the lights and
flowers.</font></center>
