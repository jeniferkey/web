<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">May 7 - Roading Update - Wiley went
out roading today like usual and I rode him along with the hounds. Unfortunately
right before we got back to the kennels the hounds broke. There were other
nervous horses and running hounds and whip cracking, but Wiley just watched
it all with interest.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some hounds came right back, but our huntsman
commandeered Wiley to go search out the others. He cantered away down the
road, leaving the other horses behind, with Chrissie blowing the horn off
of him. He did neigh a few times, but he went around the woods and stood
while Chrissie blew in the hounds.</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">April 30 -Trail Ride Update - Well,
we had a great day for a trail ride out at the hunt property. A cool day,
so most of the horses were a bit up, but for the end of April it was perfect.
Christina rode Wiley and ended up leading the group (I guess she's just
used to being out front being the huntsman). Wiley was a champ. A bit excited
to see all the horses out and feeling fresh. Christina saw no need for
lunging and just hopped up and started out. They got all the gates, so
he got a lot of practice standing for mounting. He handled the rough terrain
fine barefoot; there was no spooking in the woods, and he didn't do anything
silly. He did need a lead over his first water crossing, but he calmly
walked over any logs and navigated up and down the ravines. Afterwards
he was happy to tie at the trailers and stand while we ate and talked.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">With his work out at the kennels, he's
starting to act like an old hand at loading and going places.</font></center>
