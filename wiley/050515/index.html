<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Wiley's First Dressage
Show</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We did Intro Test A and
B. We were both a little nervous</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>right off the trailer, but
with a boost of confidence and a boost</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>into the saddle from my
parents, we saw a lot of improvement.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I hadn't given us enough
time to relax before our first class (we</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>were supposed to be the
first test of the day). Wiley was looking</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>around and I was just worried
about getting him to go in the ring.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>He went in fine but we had
a very tense test. No chance of leaving</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>the ring or not getting
our transitions, but a short trot and his head was</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>going everywhere looking
at everything. We also never hugged the rail near</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>the judges. He really didn't
trust them.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>With an hour break I sat
and relaxed and my father walked Wiley around and</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>let him graze. After the
first test he seemed to calm down quickly.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By the time I got on for
the second test he felt like he did at home.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, we had a lovely, steady
test. No real stretch at the walk (we don't have</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>that at home either), but
he was listening and calm.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Our first score was a 55
and our second a 58.5. Tons of improvement</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and a 4th and 3rd place
ribbon. I bet next time he'll be ready to be a real</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>dressage horse.</font></font></center>
