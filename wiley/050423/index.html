<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Wiley - Out and About</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Wiley's been doing great
at home. I'm comfortable working on his training and</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>even had my weekly kid riders
get on him to see what a green horse felt like.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If he gets distracted his
steering can be a little questionable, and sometimes he stops</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and stares at things, but
he's really a steady little horse.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So, he'd been out to the
kennels by himself before, but this time</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I took Adiron along to step
up the stress a bit.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>We went out walking twice,
and one had to stay back at the trailers while the other walked</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>out with us. Not exactly
what I expected, but whoever was left beind was the one who neighed</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and got upset. Whoever was
along with the hounds and people walked along happy on a loose lead.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Afterwards Christina offered
to get up on him and ride him around the trails in the woods.</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For all his fussing when
we separated him from Adiron, when Christina mounted up he</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>seemed happy to have a leader
and didn't think about Adiron. Adiron, on the other hand,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>wasn't happy to be left
alone at the trailers again and neighed constantly. Wiley did answer a
few times,</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and pulled back towards
the trailers once, but he was quite the brave horse going through</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>strange woods alone.</font></font></center>

a bath or getting groomed. Just what a grown up horse does and nothing
to worry about.</font></font>
