<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">About once a week a couple of kids, Amy
and Steven,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">come out and ride. Steven's pretty tall,
so he's usually on Bob,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and Amy's kind of short, so she's usually
on Thuy. With Thuy</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">off on vacation at the parents' for the
summer, Amy had to choose</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">between Wiley and Adiron. While Adiron
is cuter (in my opinion),</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">he's really only had 8 or so rides on
him now.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Taking that into consideration Amy chose
Wiley.</font>
