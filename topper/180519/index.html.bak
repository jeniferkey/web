It was a 'swap' drive. We didn't swap horses, but<br />      for the first half of the day half of us volunteered for timing, resetting,      and<br />      managing the starts at the obstacle course, cones and cross country.<br />      Then we had lunch and swapped and those volunteering got to drive, and<br />      those who had driven manned the show.<br />      You'd have thought my morning of resetting for the obstacles would have<br />      given me an advantage, but no. Those I watched made it look much easier<br />      than it was to try and drive it.<br />      Still, Topper was a trooper, and stood at the trailer in the shade of a      tree all <br />      morning, but had no issue then being hooked after lunch and going on our      way.<br />      And we all were pleased that our standing work at home translated and<br />      he hitched and stood better than he ever had when off property in the      past. No trying to<br />      walk off when I got in the cart, although Cinde heading was a big help.<br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="01.jpg" alt="" /><br />        For maybe 10 seconds of warm up I thought about my position. Glad Bart        got a picture of it. Topper was aware and a little worried about other        carts and noises, but compared to last year at this show, we had no        unplanned cantering in warm up.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="02.jpg" alt="" /><br />        When I was relaxed he was comfortable. We've got a wider bit and a wider        browband. At this point I don't think a bit change is going to solve        things, I think it's<br />        more my hands and how I learn habits to prepare so I don't pull too much        when I want him to re-balance or slow his trot or make a quick turn.        Those were the<br />        things that got us in trouble at this show.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="03.jpg" alt="" /><br />        A year ago we had to go around this on the entrance (even though we had        worked it in the past). This year I let him walk in and adjust to the        darkness and he went right over.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="04.jpg" alt="" /><br />        I was feeling confident enough to trot the pole bending part.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="05.jpg" alt="" /><br />        I was pleased with how close we were able to stay. It was the rollback        on the last one that caught us up and back to the walk with too much        hand that made him unhappy. So much to think about. I should have gone        to my whip to push him around. I'm fighting in my mind with don't use        the whip on the outside, but pointing his nose and engaging can still        get a popped shoulder or using both reins then gets a cranked in pony        who's being forced to turn and not asked.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="06.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Everyone else made this look easy. I've done it before with Simon and        almost pulled the spin thing over. The test is to go to the cones, grab        the rope on the spin thing, then circle it and go back through the        cones. You can see Topper's lovely cross over while being bent in the        correct direction. But again, I think if I'd have held his outside<br />        with the whip he'd have had a better understanding of what I was asking.        At least once he was past the spin thing he stopped being worried about        it because he couldn't see it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="07.jpg" alt="" /><br />        He walked right past the black longhorn cutout that I was worried about.        At this point I was letting him walk instead of going for time with        trotting to give him a breather from all the thinking he was doing.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="08.jpg" alt="" /><br />        This obstacle consisted of two barrels, take a letter off this one, and        go to the next one and put the letter in the mail box. He was a little        worried about the barrels, but again, once he couldn't see it I could        maneuver so the cart was right beside it. Standing is such a lovely        trait in a driving pony. Everyone said all the ground driving practice        would pay off in spades. </div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="09.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Here you have to drive straight in, halt, and then back out. A lovely        halt, then a squeeze on the reins and soften while saying Topper back.        Just like we were back home backing in to park the cart. I'd say his        best obstacle. But maybe I do need to bang his tail again. When he sinks        behind it's definitely hitting the ground.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="10.jpg" alt="" /><br />        A little nerve wracking driving in front of Ken. He's been my connection        to driving for the past 25 years.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="11.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Fancy pony trotting over the loud board. We've never had trouble going        over it when it was on our way out of the ring.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="12.jpg" alt="" /><br />        He looks like a little Morgan to me here. You can see the bit is a        little big for his mouth, but his face gets wide quickly and when he has        a bit that fits his mouth it pinches his cheeks and rubs off the hair.        Someone recommended trying bit guards to take up the space on each side        of his mouth. They'd need to be pretty small, though to not squeeze his        cheeks.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="13.jpg" alt="" /><br />        On to cones. I think I did way too much half halting to feel 'in        control'. I didn't see our times, but we were rather slow and he did        quite a bit of curling to try and avoid my hands.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="14.jpg" alt="" /><br />        My fault for not planning the correct line to the next set of cones. And        again, no use of the outside whip. At least my outside hand is in front        of my inside hand.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="15.jpg" alt="" /><br />        A straight line, so I did think to encourage a little.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="16.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Coming up on the cones and already starting to half halt for the turn        after. I should ride a cones course with someone, so I can feel what a        faster course feels like. I work cones so much for dressage that a        working trot feels right and that doesn't cut it in cones.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="17.jpg" alt="" /><br />        I'm pleased I'm already looking for my next set, and he's moving on, but        if I'm remembering correctly after we went through this gate he picked        up a canter. It's not allowed, so then I had to bring him back, which he        thought was silly of me.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="18.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        So here's me half halting to get that working trot I'm comfortable with.        Then in the next picture...</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="19.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        How he reacts to my strong half halts, so then I have to give the reins        to try and get him to get his nose back out. At home, a verbal 'easy'        usually works to get a nice half halt out of him. Away from home I might        over use it, because we rarely get the same response.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="20.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Giving him a bad approach to the serpentine (should have gone the other        side of 19), but I was at least half halting with the outside rein like        I learned at the clinic to create the bend to the left coming up.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="21.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        He went into the serpentine from the side, instead of head on, but once        we got around A he felt like he knew what we were doing and kept us        quite close to the inside cones.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="22.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Serpentines are easier than zig zags since there are no outside cones.        We didn't have to exit or enter straight on.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="23.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Any chance to be kind and give him rein I'd leave him to it. I think        here we both noticed the horse driving out on the cross country track. I        have to say that was the most fun part of the day.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="24.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        I only walked the course to 16 that morning and glanced at where the        last ones were since it was a similar course to Sunrise Ridge and there        was the offer of a golf cart ride back. So, here's me coming off 16 and        looking for 17. Those tight elbows are me trying to decide if we were        going to come down to a walk since I obviously wasn't looking in the        right place and couldn't find it. I did spot it shortly after this,        because we didn't overshoot it and had a smooth turn to it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="25.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        A bit of a tight circle to the next set of cones, so again, him getting        shorter than is fair. As Ken would say, practice at home and it'll get        better. Our last two weeks of driving were spent trying different bits        and settings (this pony with the broken mouth bit was mostly hollow and        braced with a bulging under neck and crossed jaw trying to run through        any bit pressure). With this mullen mouth he gives to the bit, and if my        hands are more tactful, I can get a longer length of neck like in some        of the other pictures.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="26.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Coming off of cones I'm finally relaxed, so were both relaxed and happy.        The last section was a tour around the cross country course <br />        going through numbered gates and grabbing flags to hand in at the end.        He was very suspicious of the cross country jumps laying on<br />        their sides, but had no problem driving between the jumps on the course,        even though many had bags of cedar chips waiting to be dumped.<br />        He asked to canter a couple of times, but just because the hill would        have been easier at a canter and one nice straightaway looked<br />        inviting, but only offered and came right back. One sideways shy at the        trot almost at the end as we passed a culvert made<br />        me pleased I was braced and wishing for sides on my raised seat. He was        tired, but again, much more confident about being out<br />        in country than the year before. Every once in a while I have to remind        myself I haven't been doing this for 20 years, as many<br />        of the people out there this weekend said about themselves. I was just        happy to get to drive my pony around that gorgeous place<br />        and get to talk with all the friendly horse people there.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>  </body></html>
