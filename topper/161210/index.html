        Driving Adventure<br />      </span>Probably more my driving adventure, but Topper was a big part<br />      of it. Once fox hunting season ended I was riding Topper, but<br />      had thrown the harness on him and ground driven him around.<br />      He was very relaxed and obedient and it was a contrast to when I<br />      rode him in the exact same area on the same day.<br />      I figured he had been driven, being Amish, but the sellers had not <br />      driven him themselves so I went back to the beginning.<br />      Thinking he had driven, I occasionally rushed things, but Topper<br />      was sure to make it clear when I was skipping a step.<br />      Meg was instrumental, of course, but Emily and Donna<br />      both stopped by to lend a hand when needed.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        Donna came out in the summer and ground drove him. It was hugely helpful        to see that he could take more contact and to show me how to deal with        reins. Happily she deemed him suitable and encouraged me to continue.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /><br />        I did put the cart before the horse, or pony as it may be. I knew what I        wanted, and when this came up for sale along with a suitable harness, I        bought myself a birthday present. It should fill my needs unless I        decide I need four wheels.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        Working up to a controllable trot.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /><br />        All the driving was great for building up his topline correctly.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="05.jpg" /><br />        I complained a lot that I was working as hard as he was.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06.jpg" /><br />        We did a lot of evening drives during the summer trying to find time        when the sun wasn't high in the sky.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="07.jpg" /><br />        A lot of halting and standing around. He can be an impatient pony so we        always go back to working on this.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08.jpg" /><br />        Working with poles that mimic shafts. Introducing one and then two        dragging needed side walkers. On my own I could work on it, but it was        the one step that I had to <br />        go over many times before he settled to the concept.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="09.jpg" /><br />        We did a lot of turning exercises so I could stand in the middle and not        have to move so much.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10.jpg" /><br />        With the pole and the tire, first it was me dragging with him going in        front. Luckily he's very responsive and I could switch to one handed        when I needed to.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="11.jpg" /><br />        Me concentrating. I did drop the whip, but it was still a lot to think        about to keep everything in place and keep him going calmly.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="12.jpg" /><br />        I'd reward him my trotting up and down the driveway doing figures around        the trees. I'd be tired, but he seemed to enjoy it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="13.jpg" /><br />        Our first driving show we hit without a cart. The let us ground drive        through the obstacles. He was very excited seeing all the ponies, minis,        horses, cart and carriages, but he was controllable. In the ring by        himself he was great and listened better than I expected.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="14.jpg" /><br />        Driving him around the grounds to let him see everything.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="15.jpg" /><br />        He was obedient, but sometimes worried about the other equines. I had a        lot to focus on to keep him focused on me.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="16.jpg" /><br />        Back at home and now he was pulling a travois and not concerned with the        shafts or noise at all.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="17.jpg" /><br />        The first time we introduced the cart Meg was pulling it, holding it in        the tugs, but we didn't have it attached, just in case.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="18.jpg" /> <br />        First time hooking and checking all the parts. It took a few times to        get things fitted and looking right and level.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="19.jpg" /> <br />        He was good his first time out, but did have a tantrum or two and did a        lot of head tossing. Every new thing he needs to test his boundaries.        Such a pony.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="20.jpg" /> <br />        He was more eager than anxious, which is what we wanted. He seemed to        think he was supposed to trot off after hooking, which is probably how        it was in his previous life.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="21.jpg" /> <br />        He knew when to really pull and when to balance to hold the cart back.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="22.jpg" /> <br />        He was always faster heading back to the barn, but we'd turn him away        and then back until he'd settle.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="23.jpg" /> <br />        Some more harness fitting. He has pony and cob harness parts due to his        size.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="24.jpg" /> <br />        Every time he's been more confident.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="25.jpg" /> <br />        He's got a great whoa.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="26.jpg" /> <br />        Somewhere in his background he was taught to park out. I think it's        funny. Meg has us work to not do it, since it won't be appropriate in        the dressage ring.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="27.jpg" /> <br />        Back down the hill to the carriage house. Having to navigate that        twisting hill has been good for both of us.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="28.jpg" /> <br />        Of lead. Just checking that we still had whoa.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="29.jpg" /> <br />        The harness lives in the house, so I've taken to tacking up on the        porch. He's perfect about standing there.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="30.jpg" /> <br />        Walking calmly past the scary garbage can and wheel barrows. This is a        very different horse than the one that hates going near those under saddle.        I think it's all about<br />        finding what the horse is comfortable doing for his job. I'm sure he        won't love driven dressage, but that's different than the tension he        tends to have under saddle. I take my horses to a variety of places, and        without the consistency of working in the same ring every day, he made        it clear that taking him out in harness would make him a much happier        pony.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="31.jpg" /> <br />        We've come a long way in the past year. There's a lot more to work on        once we start trailering out, but he seems very comfortable in this role.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="32.jpg" /> <br />        I've had Amish horses who were very subservient. Topper did not lose any        of his attitude, although he is suspicious of people. I think going        through this training where I was new to it and he mostly knew what was        going on, we've bonded more and he appears to trust me in the driver's        seat of the cart.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>  </body></html>
