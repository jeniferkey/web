        Topper at Willow Draw<br />
      </span>We've been out with the hunt a few times and trail riding, but I<br />
      wanted to get him in an indoor and start to show him stadium jumps.<br />
      <br />
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="1.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        Everything is new. He got very puffed up when he met the horse in the
        mirror.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="2.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        He's got a lovely personality and is so easy to handle on the ground.
        Someday that tuft of mane will grow out.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="3.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        He doesn't need the pelham, but it's Thuy's old bridle so we're just
        using it as is for the jumping.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="4.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        He was a bit hesitant starting out, but not like the first few weeks of
        riding. He'd just see things to be distracted by and forget that I was<br />
        telling him where to go.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="5.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        My trainer loves giving us poles on the ground to distract us from the
        other distracting things. It works really well.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="6.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        He tends to curl and if he's listening I can work him off my legs and
        leave the bit alone. He wasn't listening so well today.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="7.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        It's nice how fast he learns. On the purchase video it was kick, kick,
        kick to get the canter. The first few times I tried riding it was the
        same. Only a couple of months<br />
        in and I can sit and ask and we go right into it, no fast trotting. Now
        listening to both my legs while canter is definitely a work in progress.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="8.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        Today he was up, so his canter was different than at home where I have
        to keep him going. Still, it never felt out of control.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="9.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        His trot feels very smooth. It's always surprising when people mention
        his knee action.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="10.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        Cantering over poles and cavaletti. It was our first time, but he didn't
        seem worried about it.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="11.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        First jump of the day and he seemed unsure if it was what I wanted.
        Their cavaletti are a litlte shorter than ours, so he could have trotted
        it if he wanted.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="12.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        The second time felt great. I could feel him pulling me to the jump and
        telling me we were going to canter away.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="13.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        We weren't sure he'd jump at this height, but he was getting into it by
        now. Even more distractions and steering wasn't the best as he tried to
        go look at things, <br />
        but after showing him the ring and taking a couple warm up jumps we did
        a little course.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="14.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        He felt like he'd have been comfortable cantering on and taking the next
        fence, but we slowed to a trot before every jump so he<br />
        could be more confident.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="15.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        We did four jumps and changed direction across the arena. He lined
        himself up for all but the last. The last two he jumped bigger than the
        first two.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="16.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        He's clean with his hind feet also. On our second warm up he did throw a
        buck in afterward. I think I was<br />
        encouraging him to canter away (which he was doing) and he was telling
        me he already knew what to do.<br />
        So far his occasional bucks aren't intimidating.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="17.jpg" alt="" /><br />
        I was pleased that we did as much as we did this lesson. It's good my
        trainer kept pushing, because I<br />
        wasn't sure how much to do and not get him worried. He seemed happy until
        the end, though.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="18.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        And making sure he cleared that one. He wasn't straight to this one, but
        so far he's been very good about not refusing anything he's faced to.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="19.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        And a right lead canter away. We don't get it easily when I ask, but on
        our more recent rides I'm always able to get it after one or two tries.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> <img src="20.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        Following another horse through the water. No pawing like last weekend.</div>
      <div class="right"> </div>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="left"> </div>
      <div class="right"> <img src="21.jpg" alt="" /> <br />
        Going back through the water all by himself. He was more worried about
        some of the larger jumps than anything we asked him to do. After this<br />
        we went over to the ditch and without showing it to him, he jumped right
        over it. He's so willing. It'll be fun when he's got his under saddle
        work ethic down.</div>
