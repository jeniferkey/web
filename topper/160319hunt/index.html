If things got exciting I hopped<br />      off and he'd go in hand until things calmed down.<br />      His manners are impeccable on the ground and his company<br />      was always enjoyable.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        Waiting for everyone to be tacked up.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /><br />        One hunt I had pulled my back and couldn't ride, so he packed some of my        stuff and we followed all over hunt country. He wasn't concerned being        alone<br />        and it was a fun day out.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        Riding out with Laura. He had some big spooks this day at hounds, but by        the end hounds were around us in the woods and creek beds and he stayed        focused on <br />        what we were doing and not them.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /><br />        He's not used to cactus, so a bit more direction needed than my guys who        naturally go around it.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="05.jpg" /><br />        We didn't always stay up with the huntsman, but we always caught up to        her.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="06.jpg" /><br />        He really marches on and stayed well up with Laura this hunt.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="07.jpg" /><br />        Only at the very end did he start trotting instead of using his power        walk to keep up.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="08.jpg" /><br />        Heading in and letting him lead.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="09.jpg" /><br />        In our dressage saddle for now.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="10.jpg" /><br />        Our last hunt was a cold and blustery day. I didn't always stay on when        things got exciting.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="11.jpg" /><br />        After hunting last week this week he was excited to get out. When he        gets excited he doesn't always listen.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="12.jpg" /><br />        Watching the hounds and whips head out.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="13.jpg" /><br />          It's more tiring, but he's really new to this, and when he gets        excited I can calm him down by getting off and leading him for a bit.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="14.jpg" /><br />        When he's excited he can do some leaping about. It's not difficult to        ride, but he's also more prone to spooking because he's more focused on        the excitement and<br />        anything strange surprises him in that mind frame.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="15.jpg" /><br />        Watching all the excitement from a distance.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="16.jpg" /><br />        He's very aware and always tells me if something is happening that I        might not notice.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="17.jpg" /><br />        He was a little playful at the canter to begin with, but when he        realized we were going all the way up the hill he settled into a nice        canter.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img alt="" src="18.jpg" /> <br />        He wasn't confident with his canter when he came, but he appears to enjoy        cantering when he knows it's ok.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>  </body></html>
