        learning about Fox Hunting<br />      </span>Rarely have I had a horse start out during the hunt season.<br />      I like to have the summer to walk out with the hounds at the kennels.<br />      This year I'm trying to introduce Topper, but not introduce too much at      once.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="01.jpg" /><br />        <span class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption"><span            class="hasCaption">He
            was so obedient his first time at the kennels. We walked out and he            was aware of everything, but stayed right by me without<br />            crowding or getting silly.<br />          </span></span></div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="02.jpg" /> <br />        It was a cold day and we all hung out in the kennel building. Topper<br />        stayed right with us and even came in when asked.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="03.jpg" /><br />        Out on the trail ride he was energetic and obedient. He got a little        excited half way through when I think his mind<br />        was feeling overwhelmed, but the other horses kept him calm.<br />        <span class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption"><span            class="hasCaption"></span></span></div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div style="text-align: center" class="left"> <img alt="" src="04.jpg" /> <br />        He was anxious after a couple of hours, but was careful through the mud        and crossed the creeks very nicely.<span class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0"          aria-live="polite"          id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption"><span            class="hasCaption"></span></span></div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img alt="" src="05.jpg" /> <br />        <span class="fbPhotosPhotoCaption" tabindex="0" aria-live="polite" id="fbPhotoSnowliftCaption"><span            class="hasCaption">Out
            with the hunt has been very exciting, but he's learning what to            expect. I hope to be out<br />            of the dressage saddle soon, but for now it gives me a bit more            security when he gets playful.<br />            I'm sure it's hard to stay calm with other horses and hounds running            around.<br />            Typically a new horse would get to watch it from a pasture at the            kennels until it wasn't <br />            anything special. Here he's learning about it out in the field. I'm            lucky that there are<br />            hunt members who will stay with us to help keep him calm.<br />          </span></span></div>    </div>  </body></html>
