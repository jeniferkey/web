He's cantering when I ask, but<br />      doesn't have the right lead much of the time. This time<br />      we never did get it under saddle. He's smart and<br />      tries, so we'll get there.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="01.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Pictures are good to show what my trainer meant when she said I needed        to keep my hands together more.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="02.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        A lot of this happening as he learns to carry his head and not go        hollow.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="03.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Sometimes the trot gets short and I have to keep him going, but that's        improved since I first got him. Here's a tip of the nose as another<br />        resistance. I try not to go to the reins too much, but steering with my        legs isn't happening so much yet.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="04.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Nice stretch and reach over the cavaletti. He picked this up much faster        than most of the horses<br />        I've brought along.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="05.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        His regular trot can have a lot of knee and hock action, so this just        encourages that.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="06.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        It's taken a couple of months to get myself more still and I still tip        on him more than I should. He's smaller than<br />        I'm used to and takes more core strength to stay steady and in the        middle to help his balance.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="07.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        I love the bounce and all feet off the ground at once. It'd be easier to        keep my position if I were in the dressage saddle, though.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="08.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        We do a lot of bending and flexing work. He's good off the leg if he's        not distracted and listening. He's really good at getting gates,<br />        even if he's a bit excited.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="09.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        His canter is very smooth and easy to ride.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="10.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        At home I typically have to work a bit to keep him going. Away from home        he's better at keeping the canter himself.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="11.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        If I go to the bit he tends to get shorter in the neck than we want.        It's a balancing act, but once he's listening better to my legs it        should<br />        get better.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="12.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Explaining jumping with a rider and trying to canter away.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="13.jpg" alt="" /> <br />        Here we landed in a trot. He's still working it out.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="14.jpg" alt="" /><br />        I have to be sure and stay centered to help his balance.
