<center><font size=+2>What Can Happen During A Remodel</font>
<br>After grinding with my small, flat grinding tool, I decided to go to
the local hardware
<br>place and see if there was a better tool. They recommended a large,
heavy grinder meant for
<br>flat grinding. I was thrilled. It seemed perfect for the job.
<br>I got prepared for grinding -- headphones, mask and hair up in hat
-- and turned on the grinder.
<br>It seemed ok, so I touched it to the concrete. From my point of view
it exploded in my hands.
<br>There was a lot of noise and my arm hurt and I was holding nothing.
We unplugged everything and
<br>I laid on the couch until my arm didn't hurt so much. My husband surveyed
the damage.
<br>After seeing everything, I realize that I am very lucky to only have
a horrible bruise on my wrist...
<br>I can't say yet what will happen with the counters. We might have the
entire thing repoured,
<br>or maybe just the sink area. I'm pretty sure we'll have a concrete
person out to look. I don't think
<br>that I will ever pick up a grinder again.
<br>After the accident, I was told that grinding stones can explode. If
I had been told before hand, I'm
<br>not sure if anything would have happened differently.
<br>Please be careful. I commented to my husband that I was glad the stove
didn't get hit. He said
<br>he was too, because the stone would have had to go through me...</center>
