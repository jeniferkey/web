The back</font>

I don't worry about</font>

was nothing to getting the drawer fronts on close to straight. Now I need

and Monday, but I'm not sure yet. We love the color, but it is a little
greener than the doors. I know it doesn't help that the doors are maple
and the the wall is oak. Someday I'll learn to not mix types of wood.</font></center>

is a color difference. Now I'm debating with the color differences if I
can go with cheaper pine crown molding or if I need to get oak. The oak
crown isn't that bad, but where I get into cost are the crown drops I want
to put over the two vetical sections so I don't need one long piece of
crown molding.</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I did test the stain on a piece of
oak and it looked nice. What I didn't do was test it on the 1/4" plywood.
That's the stuff that has the green tint. The hand rail and the 3/4" counter
top parts don't have the green and look the way I thought it all would.
I think I might have faced the wrong side of the 1/4" backing to the front.</font></center>
