heard of before. There's both an inside and outside unit. It's supposed
to be quieter than a window unit and we didn't have to cut a large hole
in the wall. The 2 copper lines, electric lines and drain line go through
about a 3" hole through the walls down and out to the outside unit.</font></center>

unit on the ground because there's a limit to the rise it can handle. By
going to the third floor we were really pushing it's limits. We didn't
want it on the roof because of noise and vibration.</font>

These are temporary so they can get all dirty with the sheetrock work.
The final ones will extend out to the wall and have brackets to attach
them to supports in the wall. That 3rd wall support should give a lot of
strength.</font></center>

plaster look. I need to start testing out some ideas.</font></center>
