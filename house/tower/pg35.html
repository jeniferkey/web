finished</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We've replaced the wood stringers with
metal stringers from</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">http://www.artisticironworks.com/. They
were the same rise and run</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">as the wood stairs we made, so putting
them in wasn't so bad.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The difficult part was the second to third
floor, where one person had to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">stay on the third floor to lower the old
stringers and then lift up and attach</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the new stringers (which went over the
first flight of stairs, so a long way down).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It all went better than expected.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We're creating the steps out of 3/4" plywood.
Two pieces glued together and stained and sealed.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The difficult part of that is cutting
each piece to match the curve of the tower so they fit perfectly.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Here are pictures of the first floor.
Thanks go to my father for all his hard work with fitting each step.</font></center>
