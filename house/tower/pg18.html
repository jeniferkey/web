We hope to leave the openings on the left and right as pass-throughs, maybe
with shelves. The wall on this side will end up being flat after two support
walls are put up to help support the second and 3rd floor walls.</font></center>

got a great design for some shelves with arched faces for this wall. I
hope he's able to do it.</font></center>

It's been handy for throwing stuff out the tower since none of the windows
open. You can also get a glimps through the windows of the great view we
get from the 3rd floor. Bart will use this for his office when it's finished.</font></center>
