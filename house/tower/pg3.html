As it was, the second</font>

to start thinking about</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the stairs and roof lines. I was exhausted
by time we finished,</font>

access the tower from the kitchen/dining area of the main house. One of
our discussions focuses on where the stairs are going. I'd like to keep
them in the left of the picture with a bit of a curve around the side.
The other option is on the right, where we have the greatest amount of
flat inside wall. Decisions, decisions.</font></center>
