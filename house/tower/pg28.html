I figured out all the cuts I would need for the cabinets and went to HD
and they spent a lot of time matching all my measurements using the big
saw they've got. One or two mismeasurements and not everything that's 10"
is the exact same 10", but then again the space is wider at the top than
the bottom. Nothing is perfect anyway.</font></center>

it seemed easy), but a decorative piece would really be nice. Of course
I haven't figured out how to attach it. I looked at getting a biscuit joiner,
but $100 for a nosing is a bit much.</font></center>
