Stuccoed</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The stucco is a little slow going. Mainly
because the scaffold</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">has to be built up so high and tearing
it down and putting it back</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">up takes a while. So, as Lynn says, 7
hours to prep, and 1 hour to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">actually stucco.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We got in a test window&nbsp; last weekend.
I hate handling glass, so Bart did all the carrying</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and placing and I fitted the moulding.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It looks like we can save a lot of money
if we get the glass and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">put molding in to hold it in place. So
far so good. They'll probably leak,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but isn't that what caulk is for?</font></center>

doing it, so it is) that we think now we'll do the entire tower that way.</font>

we've been discussing stucco, no one likes the idea of change.</font></center>
