<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Niles' first time out fox hunting went
very well.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He seems to love the excitement and the
chance</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to be out with his other horsey friends.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We hit some trails that were marked for
the more</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">advanced horses, but Niles was brave enough
to</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">cross the deep creek (with a jump and
a splash)</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and climbed his way up the rocky trails
without hesitating.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He stayed with his group easily, happily
trotting and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">cantering along when necessary.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Next week he'll be braided up for opening
meet. Hopefully</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we'll have more pictures.</font></center>
