trot</font>

go out.</font>

some.</font>

in the dressage saddle.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I hope to move him up out hunting, so
I wanted to test</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">out the Pelham on him. It was an incorrect
combination,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but it was nice to see how he adapted.</font></center>

of a stretch after all they've had to deal with out hunting.</font></center>
