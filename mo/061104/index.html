<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was excited and nervous about our first
hunt.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Amanda, my niece was to ride Thuy, so
there was</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a lot to think about. Unfortunately she
started feeling ill</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">once we started out, and we had to turn
back to return her</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to her parents and to untack Thuy. He
had to watch as Mo</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and I rode off to find Third Flight.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mo was so good. He left the trailers without
being worried, and waited</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">while we watched the huntsman put in and
work a covert between us and</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">where Third was heading.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A very good start for his hunting career
bringing up the rear in third, and 1/2</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">way through joining a whip to give him
a break and give him a reward for</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">handling the stresses of the day. We had
a nice canter and took a jump</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">heading in. I also viewed a coyote and
enjoyed a lovely day out.</font>
