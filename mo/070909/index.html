Combined Test</font></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;</font></b>Chrissie
ended up riding Mo in his first Combined Test.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was interesting to see how he went
for someone else.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">She'd never ridden him in a dressage saddle,
and I could</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">see that he didn't soften as easily as
he had been for me.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They were 3rd after dressage with a 39.5
(might have been higher, but</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Chrissie had an error on the course).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was Mo's first time around a stadium
course, so he wasn't completely</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">focused on the job at hand. No refusals
or run outs, but the second fence</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the combinations didn't go smoothly.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All in all, we were very impressed with
his attitude. He was a little up in the dressage warm up,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but once he entered the ring he realized
it was boring dressage and even needed leg on to keep</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the canter. He was probably not sure why
the saddle got put back on for the jumping,</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but once they were jumping he listened
and followed the course that Chrissie gave him.</font></center>
