<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This year, when daylight savings time
changed for the winter, I decided that I would not ride in the dark for
another year.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">First, an electrician came out and discussed
lights on electric company poles, and adding another meter and overhead
and underground lines. The Electric Company said no to lights on their
poles, so then I started looking at poles being brought out and installed.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After two weeks of riding by car headlights,
I was willing to do almost anything.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then I had an idea, and enlisted my father's
help. He expanded on the idea, and we did the install in one day on the
weekend. Now that we've done it, we have plans to improve and possibly
make permanent what we thought would work as temporary lighting.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This was done with no digging, and the
poles can be lowered fairly easily. T posts did have to be pounded in,
but that was much easier than digging and getting really long poles, so
that they would still be tall enough after being sunk in the ground.</font></center>

<center><font face="Arial,Helvetica">An update on improvements made in
the past couple of years. We bought 10' PVC pipe and cut it in 1/2 to put
over all the t-posts. We also bought caps to go over the top and added
one more strand of tape for appearances (horses have never gotten out of
the 2 strand).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The electric line that is run out to the
two light posts was put into pvc conduit and can be seen in this picture,
but is now buried about 6" deep (used an electric edger to create the small
trench).</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The little building at the end of the
fence houses the electric fence charger.</font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We are also considering running another
electric line out into the pasture to have one more light pointing at the
far end of the arena.</font></center>

is held tightly between three T posts.</font></center>

the 4X4 isn't in the ground. If we take off the clamps, we can lower the
4X4 to replace bulbs, or reposition the lights.</font></center>

fence line at the height of one of the electric tape strands (we did this
between the two light poles, also). The horses won't touch it. The wire
goes to the end of the fence line. At that point, we put a heavy duty plug,
and run an extension cord from the house to the plug.</font></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If we did it over again, we would make
sure that the wire running from the light to the bottom of the pole was
run on the side of the pole that didn't have a T post beside it. I also
am planning to put the wire running along the fence in 1/2" PVC pipe, so
it will look better and have a little more protection. Eventually, we will
also dig a trench and bury cable from the end of the fence to the house,
so it will be hard wired to electricity.</font></center>
