The people      were very nice, the barn was lovely and the horse was patient with me.<br />      <br />      What I learned most was that even on a well trained horse I really needed      to ride the horse (duh). Every stride.<br />      He never took advantage of me, but he also didn't give me the ride just      because I was sitting on him. I had to keep him soft and round <br />      (didn't always happen) and then have that timing along with the      positioning and core muscles to keep him there while we did the fun stuff.<br />      <br />      It had me come back to Miaren with a different view. Less frustration when      he didn't start out soft and round and more forgiving <br />      when I have to remind him how I want him to stay. It also gave me a feel      to aim for in my training.<br />      <br />      All in all, a great experience at Woodlands Equestrian Club.<br />      <br />    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage3.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Getting a feel for each other. He had a neck that reminded me of Thuy's.        If it went too high then I had a hollow horse, again, like Thuy.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="dressage4.jpg" alt="" /><br />        The trainer commented a few times on my posture, but riding a horse with        this feel made me want to sit up straight. It's very different than        riding a horse<br />        you're trying to train.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage5.jpg" alt="" /><br />        We did some warm up and then did some work on collecting him and then        sending him on. It took a few tries to realize that letting him out        didn't mean <br />        strung out and on the forehand. The trainer always wanted him controlled        but engaged.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left" style="text-align: center"> <img src="dressage6.jpg" alt="" /><br />        And grinning because the shoulder in felt so nice and smooth. Miaren        isn't always this easy.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage7.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Then remembering I should be looking where we're going.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="dressage8.jpg" alt="" /><br />        And half pass. Again, great to do it on a horse that knows how and be        corrected to see<br />        how positioning will then help as I train Miaren.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage2.jpg" alt="" /><br />        I'm eager to try this on Miaren now that I have a better idea on        positioning. The trainer explained what<br />        I was doing that made it more difficult for the horse and told me how to        make it easier for him.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="dressage9.jpg" alt="" /><br />        The horse and I both concentrating very hard.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage10.jpg" alt="" /><br />        By our second canter I was getting tired and it took a few tries to end        it on a good note. I think I was riding too aggressively (how I tend to        ride Miaren)<br />        and the horse was tense in his canter, so not slow and deliberate. We        came back and now I'm working to let Miaren do the work in the canter        which is <br />        going to take some retraining for both of us. But, it will be nice to        stop nagging in the canter and have tools to use. I guess we had so much        trouble<br />        getting and keeping the canter to begin with and I never went back to        asking and leaving him alone. This horse did a good job explaining that        to me. Once I <br />        relaxed and lightened everything, I could just think canter and it would        happen and it was balanced and slow and easy.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="dressage11.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Taking a little stretch break. Neat how he just reaches for the bit at        any length.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage12.jpg" alt="" /><br />        Spanish Walk. I doubt we'll ever teach Miaren this. He already stomps        more than we'd like him to.</div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> <img src="dressage13.jpg" alt="" /><br />        This horse loved passage. Any time I gave the hint that I was going to        ask for something he'd ask if it was going to be passage. I know it's a<br />        disobedience if it's not what I want, but it was so cool to ride.</div>      <div class="right"> </div>    </div>    <div class="container">      <div class="left"> </div>      <div class="right"> <img src="dressage1.jpg" alt="" /><br />        And I've now ridden a piaffe. He wasn't always energetic with it, but        there were a few times when he was calmly skipping away with his back        feet.<br />        So kind and tolerant.</div>    </div>  </body></html>
